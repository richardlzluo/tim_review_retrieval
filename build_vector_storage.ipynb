The authors provide a snapshot of opinions on the different aspects of innovation in the way they were conceptualized in the academic literature. The insights are based on a selection of 32 peer-reviewed journal articles addressing the different challenges associated with early internationalization and innovation in such ventures. The article emphasizes that the early internationalization of new ventures should be considered as an innovation process in itself and that innovation and internationalization have a positive effect on each other. In addition, it points out the role of knowledge acquisition and networking capabilities as key innovation enablers and refers to the emergence of the lean startup perspective on the innovation processes in born-global firms.

For example, Bailetti (2012) examines how new growth-oriented technology firms can (or must) operate in a global market right from their founding. The entrepreneurs behind these technology startups must plan the internationalization of the firm in the right way from the very beginning. Moogk (2012) discusses the lean startup concept and how entrepreneurs can apply it to the process of new technology commercialization. This is done in a context of extreme uncertainty and technology startups have to learn to design and to use minimum viable products to be able to enter a market before potential competitors. Minimum viable products offer the possibility for the technology to be tested in a way that could help the evaluation and the facilitation of a firm’s global growth opportunities.'),\n",

Entrepreneurial orientation has three dimensions: i) propensity for risk taking, ii) pro-activeness toward opportunities, and ii) innovativeness (Jones & Rowley, 2011). Risk taking explains the acceptance of risks to make new opportunities and revolutionary activity (Jones et al., 2013). It shows whether a firm has a tendency for high-risk products and whether risk taking is considered a positive attitude (Ahmadi & O’Cass, 2015). Subsequently, pro-activeness means the commitment to find new opportunities and cheaper, simpler, or more effective ways of completing tasks (Jones et al., 2013). Whereas innovativeness refers to receptiveness to innovation (Jones & Rowley, 2011), some definitions emphasize the dualistic nature of innovation in terms of invention and commercialization of that invention (cf. Ahmadi & O’Cass, 2015)'),\n",

They both acknowledge the importance of opportunity recognition (Miles et al., 2015). However, entrepreneurial marketing is distinct from conventional marketing: rather than relying on the traditional 4Ps of marketing (product, price, place, and promotion), entrepreneurial marketing emphasizes the entrepreneurial 4Ps (purpose, practice, process, and people) (Martin, 2009). Entrepreneurial marketing outcomes comprise innovation and customer value (Jones et al., 2013) through firms’ proactive, innovative, risky, and opportunity- and growth oriented actions (Hills & Hultman, 2011). For example, fast growth technology companies use new approaches, interactive processes and networks to promoting and selling innovations (Jones et al., 2013), and tend to have long-term orientation to opportunity creation and exploitation (Hills et al., 2008)'),\n",

Entrepreneurial marketing is a field of marketing associated with entrepreneurial behaviour and small firm resources and practices that are based on effectuation rather than causation (Mort et al., 2012). The entrepreneurial marketing construct has evolved as a response to contemporary market conditions where creative, non-standard solutions are required to address the complex, chaotic, and fragmented nature of the business environment (Fillis, 2010). Entrepreneurial marketing describes the marketing processes of firms pursuing opportunities in uncertain market circumstances (Becherer et al., 2008), and it is used as the proactive exploitation of opportunities for acquiring and retaining profitable customers through innovative approaches to risk management, resource leveraging, and value creation (Morris et al., 2002)'),\n",
