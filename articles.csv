Many OSS packages are selected and incorporated directly into custom applications by developers, thus bypassing traditional purchasing channels and their attendant legal, standards, and technical review processes. Because of this, Information Technology (IT) management is often unaware of the OSS running in their data centers, and sometimes support and maintenance measures are not in place for OSS running in production applications. 

With the advent of regulatory structures such as the Basel II accords, the reliability of computing systems is increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny. Not having adequate support and maintenance measures in place creates a significant compliance risk for financial institutions. This article describes these risks and outlines best practices for an anti-failure program that brings systems depending on OSS packages into compliance while reducing overall operational risk.

In a recently released update, the primer concludes that, despite many advances in the use of F/LOSS in the sector over the past several years, a real and perceived lack of support remains a significant barrier to the increased adoption of F/LOSS by NFPs. 

Support is often the last thing people think of when they think of F/LOSS and NFPs. Instead, people tend to focus on the price, which is of particular importance to cash-strapped NFPs.

Traditional firms like Microsoft are not simply competing against a loose group of programmers who produce OSS; they are competing against other firms who have chosen to use OSS as part of their product or service offering. This article is an examination of competition in this new environment where firm-to-firm competition includes those firms making use of OSS.

It is a step forward in the embedded systems market toward openness and freedom of software development, and it gives QNX customers significantly greater flexibility to extend and adapt QNX technology for their own purposes. 

The new QNX model is an effort to address fundamental problems in the way proprietary embedded software is traditionally developed and distributed. Today, the rate of change to software and hardware is so rapid, and software so complex, that vendors and customers alike struggle to keep up. Often, software vendors are their own worst bottleneck, as they work to fix or extend their existing products while also attempting to satisfy new, and often divergent, customer needs. Meanwhile, the sophisticated users and customers in the embedded market often know exactly what features and functions they want; many would make the modifications themselves if allowed to do so. And many of them would welcome opportunities to cooperate and share the results of their collective development efforts, just as they would in an open source project.

The first is that companies are releasing formerly proprietary code under an open source license. The second is that open source companies are being acquired or are issuing public offerings. The third trend is that very large number of citizens increasingly uses the Internet to oppose politicians and law makers who threaten, sometimes unwittingly, the fundamental principles of open source development.   

These three trends tie into this month\textquoterights editorial theme: Clean intellectual property or clean IP.

It enables organizations that develop software, either for commercial sale or for in-house use, to accelerate project timelines, improve software quality, and reduce development costs. If not managed properly, the complexity inherent in this new world of mixed-IP (Intellectual Property) can pose business and technical risks to an organization.

In late November, it was widely anticipated that new copyright legislation would be introduced in the model of the controversial American Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The bill was rumored to include harsh anti-circumvention laws, which grant software distributors the right to seek legal remedies for circumvention of technological locks on content. In response, veteran Canadian copyright advocates issued an appeal to Canadians to take an interest in the bill and to call for fair and balanced copyright. 

Canadian citizens answered that call in unexpected numbers, both online and offline. A Facebook group, called Fair Copyright for Canadians, grew to over 25,000 members within two weeks, and provided grassroots advocacy tools to citizens. A new website, called CopyrightforCanadians.ca, established itself as a centre for news on the bill and consumer advocacy. Using these tools, Canadians wrote letters, met with politicians, and demanded balance.  With their words and their actions, not only did Canadians delay the introduction of the bill until next year, but they put copyright in the spotlight and showed legislators that fair and balanced copyright can capture the public imagination.",Ottawa,Articles,Talent First Network,12/2007,2007,Open Source Business Resource,A Rallying Moment for Canadian Open Source Software,article,104,,,,,

The arguments are many: such data spurs economic activity, helps citizens make better decisions, and helps us understand better who we are and where we are going as a country. Further, these data were collected using tax dollars, yet the government holds a monopoly which makes data available only to those able to pay the high access fees, while some data is not made available at all.

However, when one plans to study the adequacy of open source software (OSS), it is necessary to have a method of qualification and selection adapted to the characteristics of this type of software and to precisely examine the constraints and risks specific to OSS. Since the open source field has a very broad scope, it is also necessary to use a qualification method that differentiates between numerous candidates to meet technical, functional and strategic requirements.

The industry is facing challenges in public confidence at the discovery of vulnerabilities and customers are expecting security to be delivered out of the box, even on programs that were not designed with security in mind. Software maintainers must face the challenge to improve the security of their programs and are often under-equipped to do so. Some are taking advantage of open source software (OSS) for their production systems as the availability of the source code facilitates their validation and answers their need for trustworthy programs. OSS are often implemented using the C programming language (26% according to SourceForge.net), making it is necessary to investigate the security issues related to C.

This paper summarizes key concepts related to security hardening, and demonstrates its applicability on the C language. We also propose a progressive approach to integrate security services and protection measures into existing software to ultimately make it more resistant against cyber-attacks. Given our ever increasing dependability on information technologies, it becomes critically important to provide tools to maintainers that will facilitate and accelerate the security hardening process, increasing the effectiveness of the effort and lowering the resources required to do so.",Ottawa,Articles,Talent First Network,06/2008,2008,Open Source Business Resource,Security Hardening of Open Source Software,article,157,,,,,

Software flaws have many causes, but our observations show that they mostly come from two broad sources: i) design, such as a malicious or unintentional backdoor; and ii) implementation, such as a buffer overflow.

To address these problems, our research group at Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) Valcartier first worked on design issues. A prototype of a UML design verifier was built. Our approach was successful, but we faced two difficulties: i) specifying interesting security properties at the design level; and ii) scalability of the verification process. Building on this experience, we studied design patterns for the implementation of security mechanisms. The output was a security design pattern catalog, available from the authors, that can help software architects choose mature and proven designs instead of constantly trying to reinvent the wheel.

This paper addresses the implementation issues from our evaluation of currently available automatic source code verifiers that search for program sanity and security bugs. From this evaluation, it becomes clear that the choice of programming language to use when starting an open source project can have many important consequences on security, maintainability, reliability, speed of development, and collaboration. As a corollary, software quality is largely dependent on the adequacy of the programming language with respect to the desired properties of the system developed. Therefore, the adoption of open source software (OSS) should consider the programming language that was used.

Despite this trend towards openness--or perhaps due to the stark contrast openness provides--accessibility remains a difficult obstacle to overcome.

The issues surrounding accessibility take many forms. In the first article, Pierre-Paul Lemyre from the University of Montreal reminds us that everything old is new again. While the difficulties surrounding the open source licensing of software are still being resolved, those same difficulties are now being experienced when providing open access to data and knowledge.

Based on rich Internet applications, wikis, social tagging or social networking technologies, these initiatives gave birth to a revolution that has been dubbed Web 2.0. Whether they originate in non-profit or business ventures, they all add up to the ever increasing mass of accessible and reusable information.

For current information hubs that have been developed through independent channels, it is anticipated that the next step in the evolution of the web will make seamless integration possible.

In fact, along with the technological foundations of this web of ideas, practical commercial implementations are already starting to appear.

Although learning resources are often considered as key intellectual property in a competitive higher education world, more institutions and individuals are sharing digital learning resources openly and without cost, as open educational resources (OER). The issues of why this is happening, who is involved, and the important implications were addressed in a 2006 study carried out by the OECD Centre for Educational Research and Innovation with the support of the Hewlett Foundation. The main conclusions are summarised here, together with some insights from a follow-up, and not yet published, study from spring 2008.

Higher education is facing a number of challenges: globalisation, an aging society, growing competition between higher educational institutions both nationally and internationally, and rapid technological development. OER is itself one of these challenges, but may also be a sound strategy for individual institutions to meet them. The trend towards sharing software programmes through open source software and research outcomes through open access publishing is already so strong that it is generally thought of as a movement. It is now complemented by the trend towards sharing learning resources: the OER movement.

OER are a fascinating technological development and, potentially, a major educational tool. They accelerate the blurring of formal and informal learning, and of educational and broader cultural activities. They raise basic philosophical issues dealing with the nature of ownership, the validation of knowledge, and concepts such as altruism and collective goods. They reach into issues of property and its distribution across the globe. They offer the prospect of a radically new approach to the sharing of knowledge, at a time when effective use of knowledge is seen as the key to economic success, for both individuals and nations.

OER projects can expand access to learning for everyone, but most of all, for non-traditional groups of students. They thus widen participation in higher education. They can be an efficient way of promoting lifelong learning, both for individuals and for government, and can bridge the gap between non-formal, informal, and formal learning.",Ottawa,Articles,Talent First Network,08/2008,2008,Open Source Business Resource,Why Give Knowledge Away for Free?

The model offers an innovative approach to organizing collaborative efforts in the social mission sector and shares various elements of the open source model. It emphasizes self-organizing and concrete action within a network of partner organizations working on a common issue.

Constellations are self-organizing action teams that operate within the broader strategic vision of a partnership. These constellations are outwardly focused, placing their attention on creating value for those in the external environment rather than on the partnership itself. While serious effort is invested into core partnership governance and management, most of the energy is devoted to the decision making, resources and collaborative effort required to create social value. The constellations drive and define the partnership.

The constellation model emerged from a deep understanding of the power of networks and peer production. Leadership rotates fluidly amongst partners, with each partner having the freedom to head up a constellation and to participate in constellations that carry out activities that are of more peripheral interest. The Internet provided the platform, the partner network enabled the expertise to align itself, and the goal of reducing chemical exposure in children kept the energy flowing.

Building on seven years of experience, this article provides an overview of the constellation model, discusses the results from the CPCHE, and identifies similarities and differences between the constellation and open source models.",Ottawa,Articles,Talent First Network,09/2008,2008,Open Source Business Resource,Open Sourcing Social Change: Inside the Constellation Model,article,183,,,,,

In most cases, open source software  has focused on the tools and the infrastructure software used to build and deploy applications. Relative to infrastructure, little use or investment has occurred in the development of industry specific or vertical oriented open source solutions. This is not only a missed opportunity for organizations, but it is also possibly the next wave of open source collaborations.

An important lesson of OSS is a development process that requires collaboration between individuals and organizations that isn\textquoterightt necessarily driven by a traditional hierarchy of command and control. Information technology departments are driven to be more efficient while simultaneously creating innovative new solutions to meet their business needs. More and more, companies are turning to external sources for ideas that drive innovation. A series of books by Henry Chesbrough has coined the term ""innovation networks"" to discuss research and development departments that treat their research and development systems as an open system. They describe how to include partners, customers and even competitors as part of an extended research and development team.

However, that series does not answer the question ""can OSS can be used to establish innovation networks for IT departments?"". Further, what steps are required to establish a successful software innovation network and what are the resulting benefits for organizations?

Europe\textquoterights competition commissioner Neelie Kroes warned the EU\textquoterights institutions to follow suit and use open standards: ""I know a smart business decision when I see one"".

This article provides an overview of the advancements and some of the setbacks of the implementation of open source and open standards by public administrations in the 27 member states of the European Union in 2008. It is mostly based on the news items the author wrote for the European Union\textquoterights Open Source Observatory and Repository.

BI is a business management term which refers to applications and technologies that are used to gather, provide access to, and analyze data and information about company operations. BI applications are usually used to better understand historical, current and future aspects of business operations. BI applications typically offer ways to mine database- and spreadsheet-centric data to produce graphical, table-based and other types of analytics regarding business operations. BI systems give companies a more comprehensive knowledge of the factors affecting their business, such as metrics on sales, production, and internal operations, in order to to make better business decisions. Be aware that BI is a different from classical databases and much more complex.

Often this participation is organised via the Internet to enable the opportunity for customers to integrate their knowledge, experience and skills into existing, modified or entirely new market offerings reflecting their personal preferences, needs and contexts. There is a growing body of literature dedicated to the discussion of value co-creation frameworks, mechanisms and processes. However, these typically focus on the study, discussion and analysis of a small number of cases using deep, ethnographic description of their practices aiming at conceptualization and categorization of the different types of interactions between end users, the firm and the value network. Although useful, such an approach misses the advantages of an empirically driven quantitative approach that benefits from larger size samples and is more appropriate for theory building through the development and testing of hypotheses. It is important, therefore, to seek the development of a research methodology that combines the benefits of both qualitative and quantitative research approaches for studying the nature of value co-creation.

The article provides a first attempt to identify the main research steps of such a methodology. It provides some preliminary results on the key components of value co-creation between firms and end customers based on the application of web search and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) techniques. The analysis of these preliminary results is then used as an opportunity to identify a number of research questions to be addressed in future research. The emerging research questions follow the inner logic of the value co-creation phenomenon as well as the nature of the results reported in this article.

Finally, the emergence of cloud-based hosting platforms and cloud-based data services have given many enterprises access to a richer set of options for mashup creation and deployment.

Given the explosive rate of data growth in enterprise data in recent years, enterprise mashups can have meaning to just about every organization.

The cloud plays a critical role in the relevance and value of enterprise mashups. The value of a mashup increases exponentially as more data sources are incorporated into them.

The ability to integrate communications services within web applications opens up tremendous opportunities. Examples of communications enabled applications include simple click-to-call links on a website, conference calls initiated by applications or users in response to events, interactive voice response menus, and any number of other ways that communication services, such as messaging, voice, and conference calls, can be integrated into an application to add value.

By analysing the history of telecom APIs and recognising the gradual shift from a strongly vendor controlled environment to a highly accessible component of IT networks, we can recognise the shift in revenue generation from a typical monetisation model to a value based model. Additionally, we can examine how incumbents and new entrants are dealing with the more unpredictable business models and emerging methods for de-risking value based revenue opportunities.

A small company can effectively and simultaneously accomplish these goals for a fraction of the cost by implementing communications-enabled business processes or solutions, which are a set of technology components that add real-time networking functionality to applications. One particular implementation of this framework is the one provided by Coral CEA. Coral CEA is a business ecosystem anchored around CEA functionalities that are offered as building blocks, out-of-the-box components that link the capabilities and intelligence of networks platforms with the power of current applications to provide a new set of features and functionalities.

In this article, we show how a small company called Rezact, located in the ski resort town of Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, successfully implemented CEA capabilities within its own operations using Coral CEA services.

A keystone company is the member of a business ecosystem that owns, operates, and evolves the platform. The origin of the keystone concept is a good example of the importance of interdisciplinary lessons, which was the theme of last month\textquoterights issue.

In an architectural arch, the wedge-shaped piece of stone in the centre is called the keystone. It is regarded as holding all the other stones in place and the arch would collapse if it were removed. Although most arches would collapse upon the removal of any of the other stones, the keystone is usually the final stone put in place during construction and is required to realize the structural integrity of the arch. Accordingly, in addition to its central physical position in the arch, it has been given a symbolic position of disproportionate importance in relation to the other stones.

The strong symbolism of the keystone has lead to the term being applied to other situations and systems where one element exerts disproportionate influence over the other elements and therefore plays a role in maintaining the integrity of the system. In particular, the term has been adopted in the biology literature using the concept of a keystone species in an ecosystem or community. In turn, the concept and its related research have been applied to the management literature where, instead of a keystone species, a particular organization or company plays the role of a keystone in a business ecosystem.

In biology, the defining characteristic of a keystone species is that its influence is disproportionate to what might be expected based simply on its total biomass in the community. A classic example is the North American beaver (Castor canadensis), which exerts a disproportionate effect on its habitat through its dam-building activities. Although the ""keystone"" label is applied to the species, it actually reflects the role the species currently plays within a specific ecosystem. Thus, the keystone concept is context dependent; the importance of a species in one community may be different from its importance in another.

The keystone species concept has been the subject of intense debate and research activity over the past 40 years. Biologists wish to identify and study the effects of keystone species primarily to guide conservation management. The keystone species concept suggests that management efforts can be focused on protecting an individual keystone species, and these focused efforts also theoretically provide protection for the other species that depend directly on the keystone or indirectly on the community it maintains.

In business management, the keystone species concept proved to be a useful interdisciplinary lesson, but not before another concept was borrowed from biology. The framework of the biological ecosystem concept was first applied to the business management field by James Moore in 1993 when he introduced the term ""business ecosystem"" in his article ""Predators and Prey: A New Ecology of Competition."" Moore used this new term to describe an economic community of organizations that co-evolved their capabilities around a particular innovation and work cooperatively to meet the needs of customers.

Building on Moore\textquoterights work, others have extended the business ecosystem concept and suggested that the keystone species concept in biological ecosystems can be usefully applied to business ecosystems. In particular, through their book The Keystone Advantage, Marco Iansiti and Roy Levien popularized the concept of strategically minded keystone companies that, ""shape and coordinate the ecosystem, largely by the dissemination of platforms that form a foundation for ecosystem innovation and operations.""

In this issue of the OSBR, the authors offer different perspectives on a new approach for small technology companies, industry associations and business development organizations to generate revenue. The new approach builds on the keystone company concept.

These burrows offer shelter to many other species that are not able to dig underground. Without the burrows dug by tortoises many types of rodents and snakes would not be able to survive.

The purpose of this article is to provide the lessons learned from working with a top management team of a profitable business that uses a traditional approach to development and commercialization and wishes to migrate to the new approach. The article will be useful to managers and owners of existing small companies and vendor-neutral, non-profit organizations that wish to grow their businesses.

The article is organized as follows. First, a hypothetical situation of a musical band illustrates the options available to a company that wishes to increase its revenue. This example is based on our work with a local technology. Next, we describe the lessons we learned while preparing the plan to migrate the existing company to the new approach to generate revenue. The hypothetical situation is used to illustrate the lessons learned. Finally, conclusions are provided.",Ottawa,Articles,Talent First Network,09/2010,2010,Open Source Business Resource,Migrating an Existing Business to a New Approach to Revenue Generation,article,381,,,,,

The challenge is to determine what it will take to motivate the participants to pay to collaborate with each other.

To motivate participants to pay an affiliation fee, a multi-sided platform must deliver unique value to the various stakeholder groups its sides represent. For example, if a platform is designed to generate revenue from three stakeholder groups: developers, users and researchers, it must deliver unique value to each of these three groups. Developers must receive more value from participating in the platform than the value received from not participating in the platform. The same holds true for users and researchers.

To generate revenue, a platform must be designed to deliver compelling value propositions for each stakeholder group. To illustrate how this can be achieved, we will describe five lessons learned while defining value propositions for a technology company.

384,http://timreview.ca/article/384,,https://timreview.ca/article/export/bibtex/384,Chris McPhee,1913-6102,"The editorial theme for this issue of the OSBR is Sales Strategy. While ""marketing"" is everything a company does to build interest in its offers, ""sales"" consists of converting these offers into cash. By ""sales strategy,"" we refer to all sales planning and process development activities leading up to the actual selling of a product or service.

In his recent blog post at MaRS Discovery District, Mark Zimmerman answered a question he is frequently asked by the founders of startups: ""How do we find a good sales person?"" In short, his answer is ""Don\textquoterightt."" This is not meant as a slight to sales professionals, but rather, Zimmerman is advocating that companies should not equate having sales professionals to having a sales strategy.

Sales professionals have a critical role to play in a company\textquoterights success, but they are being given an impossible task if asked to sell something that has not been validated with customers. Zimmerman explains that sales professionals should be hired only once a company has validated that the value proposition resonates with customers and that the sales model will be effective. This lesson also applies to established companies, where existing sales staff require this same foundation to be effective.

So how does a company determine whether its value proposition resonates with customers? The answer, of course, is to talk to customers. In the OSBR and elsewhere, the need for early customer input is a dominant theme in recent discussions of product development, marketing, and now sales strategy. By talking to customers, listening to how they describe their needs, and interpreting how their needs could be met, a value proposition can tested and refined. It is far more efficient and effective to iteratively refine a value proposition before attempting to sell than to attempt a salvage operation in response to slumping sales. Customer input is also a critical ingredient in developing an effective sales strategy.

In this issue of the OSBR, our authors provide a diversity of perspectives on sales strategy development and implementation, including the role of customer input.  ",Ottawa,Editorial,Talent First Network,10/2010,2010,Open Source Business Resource,Editorial: Sales Strategy (2010),article,384,,,,,

In this issue of the OSBR, we offer a mainly municipal perspective under which we discuss what economic development means and what it can deliver.

Economic development acts as a headlight that can guide a city like Ottawa through a fog of national and international competition and uncertain economic realities. It is an overarching role that nudges the local government towards smart decisions around long-term investments such as infrastructure.

Achieving sustainable economic development for Ottawa means investment in the creation of a toolkit that consists of tourism development, community and social economic development, transportation access, entrepreneurship support, investment attraction, workforce development and academia, export development, and performance measurement. Such a toolkit is what encourages partnerships between stakeholders and facilitates the environment for healthy economic development conditions.

This last element, performance measurement, deserves honest attention but is often found missing in an economic development plan. Just like a private sector firm that must always have its eyes on its bottom line and profitability, a city must constantly measure its economic development execution and adapt to changing circumstances. This can be achieved through a comprehensive scorecard or dashboard that analyzes trends over time, as well as compares Ottawa\textquoterights performance versus its competitors.

Economic development is no different than the business development unit of a firm that not only has the responsibility of creating market opportunities for its company\textquoterights products, but also the crucial task of conveying back-market intelligence. From the City of Ottawa\textquoterights perspective, the product we should be selling to both local residents and international community is the city brand, including business, tourism, and academia, as well as gathering competitive intelligence to continuously tweak our offering.

Similar to cities whose future is dependent and linked to natural resources, Ottawa\textquoterights economic future is tied to a rare resource as well. However, it is not found under the earth but between the ears of the knowledge-based workers that drive innovation in Ottawa. In today\textquoterights environment, where both the knowledge-based work force and investment capital are highly fluid, the economic development challenge is to relentlessly retain and grow this knowledge resource.

Economic development is the type of investment that will help Ottawa earn its way to be one of the world\textquoterights leading centres for business, tourism, and academia.

The devastating worldwide impact of natural disasters, disease, and poverty has been raised in our collective awareness and our ability to collectively alleviate this suffering has been brought to the fore. While many of us are familiar with donating our funds to better the lives of those less fortunate than ourselves, it is often easy to overlook a core component of facing these global challenges: information technology.

The humanitarian open source movement seeks to ameliorate these sufferings through the creation of IT infrastructure to support a wide array of goals for the public good, such as providing effective healthcare or microloans to the poorest of the poor. Achieving these goals requires a sophisticated set of software and hardware tools, all of which work to save and improve lives in some of the most difficult of situations where the availability of electricity, data, IT knowledge, etc. may be low or lacking altogether. It should come as no surprise that the humanitarian open source domain attracts a great deal of attention from software developers, engineers, and others who find that they are able to both solve intense technical challenges while helping to improve the lives of others.

However, to support ongoing humanitarian needs, the communities who produce humanitarian free and open source software (HFOSS) and hardware have increasingly identified the need for business models to support their efforts. While the lower cost of using open source software and hardware solutions means that more funds can be directed to aid and comfort those in need, the goodwill of developer communities and the funds of grantees alone cannot grow the ecosystem sufficiently to meet ever-growing global needs. To face these challenges - poverty, global health crises, disaster relief, etc. - humanitarian open source projects must fully engage the market and provide cost-effective, efficient solutions to the technical aspects of these challenges.

For example, a company may release its product\textquoterights source code to the public in the hope of attracting a community of contributing developers. Such a company commits its own resources to a project, but may still hold on to the intellectual property.

The success of private-collective innovation is dependent on many factors including: project interest and value, company reputation, and project status. There are benefits and risks to private-collective innovation which must be carefully weighed before making a decision to employ this model. Private-collective innovation involves the sharing of knowledge and, in some cases, the sharing of IP that may or may not be patented.

Open standards have driven many proprietary EDA technologies to be publicly released as free/libre open source software (F/LOSS) and some have become IEEE standards. Competition has partly given way to collaboration and has led to these standards. The development path of important EDA tools frequently now employs F/LOSS practices, which have overcome resistance to collaborative innovation between competing businesses. F/LOSS technologies are at the vanguard of leading-edge system-on-chip (SoC) design, not just because they are free, but also because they are valuable. 

The first commercial integrated circuits (ICs), designed by hand, helped guide manned space flight to the moon on the Apollo missions. In the past decade, silicon IP firms have shown they are limited only by their ideas, not by limited investment opportunities, and SoC firms have shown they can greatly reduce costs while innovating on the development of the largest new IC designs. This high-end technology is made accessible to startups because of open source. It is no longer just for mega-corporations. 

This article reviews the history of key advances in ICs and EDA tools. The common theme presented in this article for the driver of technology innovation is the requirement to develop the most advanced microprocessor possible. Today, a low-cost, high-value-added business model can efficiently serve the market for IC subsystems licensed as intellectual property (silicon IP) in the form of compilable source code. Alternatively, for larger SoC designs, engineering budgets can be shifted from the purchase of a relatively small number of high-cost EDA tool licenses to open source EDA technologies that can be run on massive compute-server farms. The two business models are not theoretical, but realistic. The author explains how his company (Crack Semiconductor) developed commercially successful cryptographic silicon IP using entirely open source EDA technologies and how another company (SiCortex) pushed the limits of IC design and open source EDA tools by simulating and verifying a massively parallel supercomputer.",Ottawa,Articles,Talent First Network,05/2011,2011,Open Source Business Resource,Developing Silicon IP with Open Source Tools,article,442,,,,,

They allow businesses to quickly take a concept to the market to see if it will work. If the business takes off, these same technologies are ready to scale the business to reach global markets and to stay profitable the entire time.

In this article, an outline is provided of key business models that have proliferated as a result of new technologies, namely multi-sided platforms, long-tail markets, and freemium business models. Next, the author describes FreebirdConnect.com, his new platform business that has emerged out of Carleton University\textquoterights Technology Innovation Management program. This platform can be used by other entrepreneurs to start a new business venture that can reach new markets around the world. Finally, the article describes the steps that an entrepreneur can follow to start a low-risk, global business on the FreebirdConnect.com platform without substantial start-up capital.

We find that signature traits of successful founders include: motivation by the desire to build wealth, and not by the inability to find traditional employment, nor because they developed a technology in a lab environment and wanted to see it make an impact; belief that startup success was due to prior industry or work experience, lessons learned from previous successes and failures, the company\textquoterights management team, and good fortune, not because of state or regional assistance or alumni networks; access to mentors, and little financial pressure for a steady income.

Despite this acknowledgment of the significant value of patents for large corporations, many small technology companies are understandably more focused on the near-term costs of obtaining a patent rather than future value. Costs may seem prohibitive to an early stage technology startup. Some software startups question whether patents are relevant to their business. 

In practice, effective intellectual property (IP) strategy and management is dependent on many factors, such as technology or industry sector, size and maturity of the business, technology lifecycle, and the business and market environment. IP strategy must be aligned to business strategy from the outset. By considering IP in the broader context of the overall business plan and the competitive environment, opportunities for generating increased return on R&D investment and added business value through patents or other forms of IP can be recognized early on. This approach ensures that a decision about whether or not to patent is driven by business reasons rather than budget constraints.

This article examines the costs and benefits of patents from the perspective of early-stage technology startups and growing businesses, and it provides some general guidance on best practices for developing an IP and patent activity plan and for building a patent portfolio that appropriately supports business objectives.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,12/2011,2011,Technology Innovation Management Review,Patent Value: A Business Perspective for Technology Startups,article,501,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/501,"business value, intellectual property, patenting costs, patents, strategy",5-11,1,

This view is far too restrictive and is at odds with many empirical and theoretical works. Therefore, we propose an analysis of patent management that considers the properties of knowledge-based economies explicitly. Patents are thus shown to be critical instruments for coordinating innovative activities between firms. They not only exclude potential infringers, but also “include” all the heterogeneous stakeholders of the innovation process. Patents facilitate coordination via two mechanisms: they encourage the emergence of markets for technology (market coordination) and they play an important role in formal and informal inter-firm collaboration (non-market coordination).

Open source governance models describe the control points that are used to influence open source projects with regard to access to the source code, how the source code is developed, how derivatives are created, and the community structure of the project. Governance determines who has control over the project beyond what is deemed legally necessary via the open source licenses for that project. The purpose of our research is to define and measure the governance of open source projects, in other words, the extent to which decision-making in an open source project is ""open"" or ""closed"". We analyzed eight open source projects using 13 specific governance criteria across four areas of governance: access, development, derivatives and community.

Our findings suggest that the most open platforms will be most successful in the long term, however we acknowledge exceptions to this rule.

The purpose of this article is to identify the themes that dominate the technology entrepreneurship literature, provide a definition of technology entrepreneurship, and identify its distinguishing aspects relative to economics, entrepreneurship, and management. 

The author argues that technology entrepreneurship is an investment in a project that assembles and deploys specialized individuals and heterogeneous assets to create and capture value for the firm. What distinguishes technology entrepreneurship from other entrepreneurship types (e.g., social entrepreneurship, small business management, and self-employment) is the collaborative experimentation and production of new products, assets, and their attributes, which are intricately related to advances in scientific and technological knowledge and the firm\textquoterights asset ownership rights.

The lack of a common definition hinders research and raises questions about which social or profit-making activities fall within the spectrum of social entrepreneurship. To become an important stream in the entrepreneurship literature, social entrepreneurship needs to be properly defined and it requires a theoretical framework that links it to the theory of entrepreneurship.

Next, we contrast the Kirznerian and Schumpeterian views of entrepreneurship to illustrate that – to go global – Chinese entrepreneurs must shift from an emphasis on exploiting pricing inefficiencies (i.e., Kirznerian entrepreneurship) to an emphasis on innovation (i.e., Schumpeterian entrepreneurship).

Currently, technology entrepreneurs make many expensive mistakes. They invest in assets and develop capabilities that prove to have limited value. They take too long to discover and validate the product-market fit for their firms during the investment stage and run out of time and money. Understanding how theory can help entrepreneurs make decisions during the investment stage is important to accelerate new-firm formation and growth as well as to reduce the uncertainty of founders and stakeholders of technology firms. 

This article introduces a model developed to examine deal making during the investment stage of a new technology firm. It is an extension of a model of lateral firm scope proposed by Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrom. The extensions come from considering a technology firm as being both a deal-making entity and a pool of resources during the investment stage. A deal is the result of a decision the entrepreneur and others make to coordinate (i.e., work together to achieve a common objective). Benefits from a deal include cash profits for the firm and private benefits for the entrepreneur. 

This extended model is then applied to examine the author\textquoterights firm which is still in the investment stage. Application of the extended model to a real-life situation generated two important insights: i) when private benefits include learning from experimentation, the number of deals increases and ii) at the start of the investment stage, private benefits drive deal-making, whereas at the end of the investment stage, cash profits derived from asset ownership drive deal-making.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,05/2012,2012,Technology Innovation Management Review,Applying the Theory of the Firm to Examine a Technology Startup at the Investment Stage,article,556,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/556,"deals, investment, technology entrepreneurship, theory of the firm",23-27,2,

One source of the “information fog” is fragmented funding. Nonprofit organizations have multiple types of funders, most of whom are not their direct beneficiaries. Predicting funder behaviour is therefore more of an art than a science. Planning for the future, setting goals, and making decisions all suffer in the nonprofit sector because of a lack of timely and accurate information.

This article examines the opportunities to use newly available digitized information to address this information deficit. It shows how the rich, variegated and fast-changing landscape of information available online can be collected, combined, and repurposed in order to deliver it in actionable forms to decision makers across the nonprofit sector. This information can significantly improve planning decisions and enhance the effectiveness of the sector. 

The article concludes that a cultural shift is required in order for the nonprofit sector to exploit the opportunities presented by digital information. Nonprofits and funders are enjoined to increase their numeracy and to find creative ways to use data as part of their evaluation, planning and decision making. Researchers need to be adventurous in their use of quantitative information and specifically should employ linked datasets in order to explore previously unanswerable research and policy questions.

Unfortunately, current research on the subject is ambivalent. To provide some clarity, this innovation management dilemma was examined in a fast-growing, medium-sized communication and IT consultancy (“First”), which claimed to be “highly innovative”. Detailed data on five projects was collected over an 18-month period using practice-based methods. Each project team was followed in real time via observation and interviews. The data was then analyzed by dividing project work into three phases: i) negotiating the project particulars with the client; ii) conducting project work; and iii) project evaluation. This detailed analysis revealed how time pressures eliminated innovation in First\textquoterights client-based project work and suggested three implications for the management of innovation.

Most IT organizations have little capacity to carry out transformational initiatives because they are focused on incremental improvements needed to run the business.

This is especially true when the ecosystem members already have a prior history of cooperation or competition with each other, as opposed to where a new ecosystem is created.

Landscape theory, a political science approach to predicting coalition formation and strategic alliances, can be a useful complement to ecosystems studies by providing a tool to evaluate the best possible alliance options for an organization, given information about itself and the other companies in the system. As shown in the case study of mobile device manufacturers choosing platform providers in the mobile ecosystem, this tool is highly flexible and customizable, with more data providing a more accurate view of the alliances in the ecosystem. At the same time, with even basic parameters, companies can glean significant information about which coalitions will best serve their interest and overall standing within the ecosystem.

The six startups examined combined the use of the Internet with: i) a relationship with a multi-national, ii) distributors, iii) re-sellers, or iv) a direct sales force. They also delivered programs to support partners and customers that focused on communications, alliance and network development, education, marketing and promotion, and financial incentives.

One of the ways to deal with uncertainty is the utilization of simulation techniques and tools, which provide greater predictability of decision-making outcomes. For example, simulation has been widely applied in decision-making processes related to global logistics and production networks at the strategic, tactical, and operational levels, where it is used to predict the impact of decisions before their implementation in complex and uncertain environments.

Regardless of whether the IT function has been outsourced or is resident within a firm, the objectives of the IT organization must be aligned to the strategic needs of the business.

It is often a challenge to balance the demand for IT against the available supply within the firm. Most IT organizations have little capacity to carry out activities that go beyond the incremental ones that are needed to run the immediate needs of the business. A process-ambidexterity framework for IT improves the IT organization\textquoterights entrepreneurial ability, which in turn, better aligns the IT function with the business functions in the firm.

Process ambidexterity utilizes both process alignment and process adaptability. This article presents a framework for process alignment in IT. This is useful for understanding how the processes in Business Demand Management, a core component of the process-ambidexterity framework for IT, relate to those in IT Governance and IT Supply Chain Management. The framework is presented through three lenses (governance, business, and technology) along with real-world examples from major firms in the USA. Enabling process alignment in the IT function, and process ambidexterity overall, benefits those who govern IT, the executives who lead IT, as well as their peers in the business functions that depend on IT.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,11/2012,2012,Technology Innovation Management Review,Enabling Process Alignment for IT Entrepreneurship,article,626,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/626,"exploitation, exploration, IT function, process alignment, process ambidexterity",13-20,2,

Therefore, research on what enterprise users value in OSS is of paramount importance to OSS solution suppliers; it can be used to create a new customer base and sustain an existing one. 
This study examines the value of OSS as perceived by enterprise customers. Through an analysis of three literature streams (firm participation in open source software, business models, and customer value), a model on customer value creation was developed. Interviews were conducted with nine decision makers from enterprises that use OSS in operational projects. The key findings of this research are that: i) the maturity of the software determines the degree to which customers value their relationship with the supplier; ii) customers value differentiating functionality and costs savings; and iii) switching costs with OSS depend on the size, complexity, and dependencies of the software itself. This research identifies the points of value that the suppliers of OSS should focus on, and it points to the need for marketing strategies that can demonstrate this value to enterprise customers.

After building a large database of projects (n=174,333) and implementing a major survey of open source developers (n=1403), we were able to conduct statistical analyses to investigate over forty theoretically-based testable hypotheses. Our data firmly support what we call the conventional theory of open source software, showing that projects start small, and, in successful cases, grow slightly larger in terms of team size. We describe the “virtuous circle” supporting conventional wisdom of open source collaboration that comes out of this analysis, and we discuss two other interesting findings related to developer motivations and how team members find each other.

However, the influence of recruitment and retention of participants in these projects has received comparatively less attention from researchers. Nevertheless, these concerns are significant for practitioners, especially regarding the apparently decreasing ability of the main open online projects to attract and retain new contributors. A possible explanation for this decrease is that those projects have simply reached a mature state of development. Marwell and Oliver (1993) and Oliver, Marwell, and Teixeira (1985) note that, at the initial stage in collective projects, participants are few and efforts are costly; in the diffusion phase, the number of participants grows, as their efforts are rewarding; and in the mature phase, some inefficiency may appear as the number of contributors is greater than required for the work.

In this article, we examine this possibility. We use original data from 36 Wikipedias in different languages to compare their efficiency in recruiting participants. We chose Wikipedia because the different language projects are at different states of development, but are quite comparable on the other aspects, providing a test of the impact of development on efficiency. Results confirm that most of the largest Wikipedias seem to be characterized by a reduced return to scale. As a result, we can draw interesting conclusions that can be useful for practitioners, facilitators, and managers of collaborative projects in order to identify key factors potentially influencing the adequate development of their communities over the medium-to-long term.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,01/2013,2013,Technology Innovation Management Review,Sustainability of Open Collaborative Communities: Analyzing Recruitment Efficiency,article,646,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/646,"DEA modeling, efficiency, recruitment, Wikipedia",20-26,3,

This article attempts to reconceptualize some assumed notions of the processes involved in developing open source software. It takes the stance in favour of studying the fluctuant nature of open source and the associated artefacts, not as well-defined objects, but as commons that are continually built upon, evolved, and modified; sometimes in unexpected ways. Further, the governance of these commons is an ongoing process, tightly linked with the way in which these commons are allowed to further develop.

This approach reduces the amount of glue code that still needs to be written and maintained, it shortens the time it takes developers to create a prototype, and it makes it easier for glue code to be reused in the future. It also allows developers to experiment with different configurations of platform components in order to find the configuration that best meets the customer\textquoterights requirements.

Business ecosystems are a strategy for entrepreneurs to access and exchange many different aspects of value, resources, and benefits.

These risks are significant and can inhibit a startup\textquoterights growth. In this article, the literature on business ecosystems is reviewed as it relates to risk to discover insights of relevance to entrepreneurs, top management teams, and business-ecosystem operators. First, the published research is organized into two streams: i) risks relating to categories of business ecosystems, and ii) risks relating to participating in business ecosystems. Then, the problem is abstracted to develop a potential strategy for managing these risks, which features a pre-entry inspection followed by real-time resource management.

This strategy can help entrepreneurs short-cut the growth of a customer base, reduce development effort, and shorten the time to market with a minimum viable product. However, this strategy is not without risk; entrepreneurs need to be careful that the acquired intellectual property rights are not fraught with issues that could severely outweigh any perceived value. Proper investigation is required to ensure success because the current literature fails to provide tools that an entrepreneur can apply when considering the acquisition of intellectual property. 

This article includes a case study of a technology company – Piranha Games – that indirectly acquired sole and exclusive access to a substantial historical customer base by acquiring and licensing older technology and surviving intellectual property assets. The founders then leveraged the existing product brand and its historical customers to acquire significant funding and went global with a minimum viable product in three years.

These nine trends have reached various levels of maturity, and some – such as quantum computing – are still theoretically contentious. These trends are: cloud computing; big data; the Internet of Things; the mobile Internet; brain–computer interfaces; near field communication payment systems; mobile robots; quantum computing; and the militarization of the Internet.

What these nine trends have in common is that they will be instrumental in generating new opportunities for offending, which will result from an exponential increase in the quantity of data, number of connection points to the Internet, and velocity of data flows that irrigate the digital ecosystem. As a result, more opportunities for malicious exploitation will be available to attackers, “security by design” will be harder to achieve in such a fluid and dynamic environment, and the performance of control mechanisms is likely to erode significantly. 

Technical solutions to address these challenges are already being developed by computer scientists. This article focuses on a different and complementary approach, finding inspiration in the work of regulatory scholars who have framed promising theories such as regulatory pluralism and responsive regulation to explore options for the necessary institutional adaptation to these future changes.

We envision timely, relevant peer-to-peer sharing of threat information – based on current technologies – as a solution to these problems and as a useful design pattern for defensive cyberwarfare. In our setting, network nodes form communities that we call enclaves, where each node defends itself while sharing information on imminent threats with peers that have similar threat exposure. In this article, we present our vision for this solution.

In spite of the considerable research and development investments made for more than 30 years, many government, industrial, financial, and consumer information systems continue to be successfully attacked and exploited on a routine basis. One of the main reasons that progress has been so meagre is that most technical cybersecurity solutions that have been proposed to-date have been point solutions that fail to address operational tradeoffs, implementation costs, and consequent adversary adaptations across the full spectrum of vulnerabilities. Furthermore, sound prescriptive security principles previously established, such as the Orange Book, have been difficult to apply given current system complexity and acquisition approaches. To address these issues, the authors have developed threat-based descriptive methodologies to more completely identify system vulnerabilities, to quantify the effectiveness of possible protections against those vulnerabilities, and to evaluate operational consequences and tradeoffs of possible protections. 

This article begins with a discussion of the tradeoffs among seemingly different system security properties such as confidentiality, integrity, and availability. We develop a quantitative framework for understanding these tradeoffs and the issues that arise when those security properties are all in play within an organization. Once security goals and candidate protections are identified, risk/benefit assessments can be performed using a novel multidisciplinary approach, called “QuERIES.” The article ends with a threat-driven quantitative methodology, called “The Three Tenets”, for identifying vulnerabilities and countermeasures in networked cyber-physical systems.

As cyberadversaries have become more mature, sophisticated, and disciplined in their tradecraft, the science of security engineering has not kept pace. The evidence of the erosion of our digital security – upon which society is increasingly dependent – appears in the news almost daily.

In this article, we outline a research agenda designed to begin addressing this deficit and to move information system security engineering toward a mature engineering discipline. Our experience suggests that there are two key areas in which this movement should begin. First, a threat model that is actionable from the perspectives of risk management and security engineering should be developed. Second, a practical and relevant security-measurement framework should be developed to adequately inform security-engineering and risk-management processes. Advances in these areas will particularly benefit business/government risk assessors as well as security engineers performing security design work, leading to more accurate, meaningful, and quantitative risk analyses and more consistent and coherent security design decisions.

Threat modelling and security measurement are challenging activities to get right – especially when they need to be applied in a general context. However, these are decisive starting points because they constitute the foundation of a scientific security-engineering practice. Addressing these challenges will require stronger and more coherent integration between the sub-disciplines of risk assessment and security engineering, including new tools to facilitate that integration. More generally, changes will be required in the way security engineering is both taught and practiced to take into account the holistic approach necessary from a mature, scientific discipline.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,08/2013,2013,Technology Innovation Management Review,A Research Agenda for Security Engineering,article,715,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/715,"cybersecurity, information system security engineering, research, risk management, security engineering, security measurement, threat modelling",41-50,3,

For most projects, time (i.e., the schedule) becomes a management ""red flag"" that signals when something goes wrong or gets out of control. The challenge for projects involving significant innovation is that one or more critical activities may be of an unknown duration or involve factors outside the normal design process and require ""red flagging"" from the outset. Managers of innovation projects have to distinguish between those activities or work packets that are a part of “business as usual” and those that involve innovation. They must identify and quantify the schedule risks and develop strategies to mitigate them. For example, one strategy to manage time-related risk is to decouple the innovation value as perceived by the customer (innovation output) from the technology innovation that is needed to deliver the product value in a cost-effective manner (innovation input). This strategy should take into account the likely consequences of longer-than-anticipated innovation time. Two common risks associated with poor time management for innovation are running out of financial runway to reach sustainable revenue and missing a critical market window.

The overall aim is to enable truly sustainable living through radically reduced energy and resource use thus addressing both environmental and social aspects of sustainability. Earlier research has shown that contemporary housing developments, including those with a sustainable profile, do not profoundly question modern lifestyles and consumption, which is a necessity to overcome limitations of a technological focus on environmental efficiency in construction. Thus, we see an opportunity for the discipline of architecture to engage in current investments in living lab facilities in order to push innovation in the field of sustainable housing.
We introduce the concept of a ""Habitation Lab"", which will provide an arena for radical and high-risk design experimentation between users, building-sector actors, and academia, and we describe a case study of a planned Habitation Lab within a living lab facility where traditional solutions for daily living and habitation are questioned and new architectural innovations are explored and evaluated. The idea of using experimental activities in the field of housing is not new, and we argue that new investments should build on earlier experiences to avoid perpetuating misconceptions and repeating past failures. Furthermore, to ensure the dissemination and uptake of results, the design of the Habitation Lab should consider the innovation and learning trajectories of the building sector.

For micro-, small,- and medium-sized enterprises, innovation activities are both crucial and demanding because of limited resources, competencies, or vision to innovate their offerings. To support these organizations, the concept of living labs as a service has started to emerge. This concept refers to living labs offering services such as designing the idea-generation processes, planning or carrying out real-world tests of innovations, and pre-market launch assessments. In this article, we will present the findings from a study of micro-enterprises operating in the information technology development sector, including the experienced value of services provided to the companies by a research-based living lab. We share experiences from Botnia, our own living lab in northern Sweden. In this living lab, our aim of creating value for customers is of key importance.

In this article, we embrace a definition of innovation as “the adoption of a new practice by a community” where the innovator is the one who does not only sense and move into new opportunities but also mobilizes all the necessary resources needed by customers to adopt a new practice. The emphasis on adoption merges together innovation and entrepreneurship by shifting the focus from the inventor and the designer, through the entrepreneur, to the ultimate recipient of the innovative outcomes. Looking at customers as co-creators is critically important for technological product adoption; missing the chance to enable their creativity is equivalent to missing the opportunity of seeing them for who they really are. The result is a distorted vision that is ultimately rooted in the misconception of the dynamics of customer value. We particularly emphasize two points: i) the increasing degree of complexity of everyday technological products requires a higher degree of creativity by customers to adopt; and ii) customer creativity is not only a function of user-technology interaction, it is a function of the various actors in the interactive environment surrounding the customer such as other customers, other technologies, local distributors, customer/technical support providers, and competitors.

In this article, we examine the product development and entrepreneurship literature streams to identify the barriers that managers of development projects of large technology firms face in allowing employees to act entrepreneurially.

Then, building on the literature and our combined 40 years of experience managing development projects in large technology firms, we provide recommendations to managers on how to overcome these barriers. 

A better understanding of how to enable employees to act entrepreneurially will increase the entrepreneurial orientation of development projects in large technology firms. The relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and development project performance is expected to be curvilinear. Therefore, an increase in entrepreneurial orientation is expected to improve the performance of development projects up to a point after which it is expected to decrease it.

The purpose of this article is to study how different knowledge-based antecedents influence the ability of service organizations to innovate. Using data about the Norwegian service sector from the 2010 Community Innovation Survey, we examined how three types of competence, namely R&D activities, employee-based activities, and customer-related activities, influence the propensity of firms to introduce radical or incremental innovations. The results show that R&D-based competence is important for service firms when pursuing radical innovations, whereas employee-based activities such as idea collaboration are only found to influence incremental innovations. The use of customer information was found to be an important driver for both radical and incremental innovations. The findings points to managerial challenges in creating and balancing the types of competence needed, depending on type of innovation targeted by an organization.

The evolution of business perspectives to the IOT is driven by two underlying trends: i) the change of focus from viewing the IOT primarily as a technology platform to viewing it as a business ecosystem; and ii) the shift from focusing on the business model of a firm to designing ecosystem business models. An ecosystem business model is a business model composed of value pillars anchored in ecosystems and focuses on both the firm\textquoterights method of creating and capturing value as well as any part of the ecosystem\textquoterights method of creating and capturing value. The article highlights three major challenges of designing ecosystem business models for the IOT, including the diversity of objects, the immaturity of innovation, and the unstructured ecosystems. Diversity refers to the difficulty of designing business models for the IOT due to a multitude of different types of connected objects combined with only modest standardization of interfaces. Immaturity suggests that quintessential IOT technologies and innovations are not yet products and services but a ""mess that runs deep"". The unstructured ecosystems mean that it is too early to tell who the participants will be and which roles they will have in the evolving ecosystems. The study argues that managers can overcome these challenges by using a business model design tool that takes into account the ecosystemic nature of the IOT.

KIBS have been discussed in innovation-related literature for over 15 years, with the assumption that models of innovation developed for manufacturing firms were not appropriate for them. This body of literature has also helped to identify the key characteristics and types of KIBS. However, although some empirical studies have investigated KIBS at the level of management – for example, how to manage customers\textquoteright co-production processes – there has not been much research on how to successfully establish and manage engagements among KIBS providers, clients, and other collaborators. Moreover, informal conversations with KIBS professionals show that these activities are often approached in an ad hoc manner. Yet, given the importance of KIBS, taking a more systematic approach to their design and management could improve the contribution of knowledge-intensive business service activities to our economy.

This article proposes a framework for the design and management of KIBS engagements. The framework has been developed from a multiple-case study of academic R&D service engagements, as one type of KIBS engagement. It consists of a set of information to be gathered and questions to be asked by professionals responsible for establishing, monitoring, and managing KIBS engagements.

These failures are, in part, due to a lack of continual and balanced innovation that firms should aim to achieve. That is, although firms may succeed at either refining existing competencies for incremental innovations or exploring new opportunities for radical innovations, many firms have experienced great difficulty in simultaneously pursuing and realizing success in both areas. This innovation imbalance arises when firms stick to traditional strategic notions of competition in fast-moving industries; these firms have not realized that the ability to compete in current and new markets begins with the strategies and priorities that are responsible for the very nature of innovation capabilities. The purpose of this study is to offer a reconceptualization of notions related to organizational strategy that are responsible for driving innovation capabilities. Specifically, this study develops a continual innovation framework that illustrates the impact ambidextrous strategies and priorities have on the firm\textquoterights ambidextrous innovation capability.

Sepúlveda Estay,1927-0321,"Supply chains have become more vulnerable in recent years, and high-profile cyber-attacks that have crippled the supply chains of well-known companies reveal that the point of entry for hackers is often through the weakest link in the chain. Exacerbated by growing complexity and the need to be visible, these supply chains share vital streams of information every minute of the day, thereby becoming an easy and highly lucrative target for talented criminals, causing financial losses as well as damaging brand reputation and value. Companies must therefore invest in supply chain capabilities to withstand cyber-attacks (i.e., cyber-resilience) in order to guard against potential threats. They must also embrace the reality that this often-unknown dimension of risk is the ""new normal"". Although interest on this topic has grown in the business world, less has been reported by the academic community. One reason for this could be due to the convergence of two different disciplines, information technology and supply chains, where supply chain cyber-risk and cyber-resilience appear to have a natural fit. The topic of cyber-resilience in supply chains is still in early stages of development, and this is one of the first journals to focus a special issue on it. Currently, the closest academic literature is within the realms of supply chain risk and resilience, where numerous models and frameworks exist. In this article, this literature is explored to identify whether these models can incorporate the dimension of cyber-risk and cyber-resilience. In doing so, we create a research agenda for supply chain cyber-resilience and provide recommendations for both academia and practice.

However, the technological architecture and the functionality of such devices require an ecosystem approach to the value creation process. Thus, the present article adopts an ecosystem approach to including cybersecurity as part of their value proposition. It extends the value blueprint approach suggested by Ron Adner to include an additional dimension that offers the opportunity to define: the potential locations of cybersecurity issues within the ecosystem, the specific nature of these issues, the players that should be responsible for addressing them, as well as a way to articulate the added cybersecurity value as a competitive differentiator to potential customers.

In this article, a club theory model for botnet-enabled cyber-attacks and botnet takedowns is developed. Initiatives to execute and resist botnet-enabled cyber-attacks and botnet takedowns are conceptualized as collective actions carried out by individuals and groups organized into four types of Internet-linked clubs: Attacker, Defender, Botbeheader, and Botmaster. Five scenarios of botnet-enabled cyber-attacks and five scenarios of botnet takedowns are examined to identify the specific dimensions of the three constructs and provide examples of the values in each dimension.

Our alternative draws on three fundamental ideas that are emerging in different pockets of the creativity literature in a way that can be readily conceptualized and applied in practice. The first idea is that creativity is really about ""creativities"", or a cluster of different and discrete qualities that can be combined to suit the context in which they operate. The second is that creativity is not static: it is about ""creativitying"", or the action and the practice of combining these creativities, which evolve over time. The third is that being creative in organizations is not an individual act: rather, it is the multiple activities of groups as they go about creativitying.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,07/2015,2015,Technology Innovation Management Review,Toward a New Understanding of Creative Dynamics: From One-Size-Fits-All Models to Multiple and Dynamic Forms of Creativity,article,910,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/910,"action-embedded creativity, creative dynamics, creativities, creativity, creativitying, innovation, management",14-24,5,

Through an analysis of the last 30 years of the creative journey of elBulli, this contribution highlights that Adrià and his team of chefs succeeded in articulating two different processes: i) a process of creativity that aimed at defining a new “school” of high cuisine and ii) a process of innovation that was expressed by the new gastronomic experiences offered to the (happy few) customers of the restaurant until its closure in 2011. A careful examination of the coupling and decoupling of these two processes shows how they fueled each other, and how the management of the organization (through a specific type of ambidexterity) was conducive to the adequate articulation of the two processes.

Although creativity is essential for the development of new luxury goods and services, this article highlights that some luxuries are timeless and eschew the changes associated with radical creative transformations.

Despite its touted benefits, little empirical research has been done to date to investigate technological and individual personal factors that determine the success or failure of enterprise gamification initiatives. In this article, we provide a summary of our preliminary research findings from three case studies of gamification initiatives across different business contexts and present an empirically validated descriptive framework that details the key success factors for enterprise gamification. Our adaptation of the mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics (MDA) framework for enterprise gamification aims to explicate the connections between end-user motivations, interactive gameplay elements, and technology features and functions that constitute effective gamification interventions in the enterprise. Following a discussion of the core elements in the framework and their interrelationships, the implications of our research are presented in the form of guidelines for the management and design of gamification initiatives and applications. The research findings presented in this article can potentially aid in the development of game mechanics that translate into positive user experiences and foster higher levels of employee engagement.

This complexity gap can be closed with new governance solutions that include participation, interaction, and cooperation among stakeholders; collective learning processes; coordination by mutual adjustment and clear systemic direction, decentralization, diversity, and experimentation; and effective measures to overcome system rigidities and development bottlenecks.

That shift affects the ways in which citizens interact with and within their physical and virtual surroundings. The interactions define purposes for the modern hybrid spaces, depending on individual demands in relation to space and time. As facilities per se are becoming less relevant, spatial concepts and service that support, attract, and engage modern individuals must be invented. The capabilities of user-orientated processes are important in terms of connectivity, co-creation, and communication, involvement in change, and control as well as governance. This article explores the potential scaling in diverse spatial transformations and summarizes the lessons learned from managing a campus as a small city to managing a larger-scale urban area. The study uses a case study methodology: the data was collected through interviews and document analysis. The framework of five urban capabilities (5Cs), which were initially introduced by the urbanist John Worthington, guided the content analysis of data. The results indicate that the lessons learned in the diverse urban projects can be scaled from a minor urban-area campus to a large urban area.

Whether evolutionary or revolutionary, 3D printing technology is recognized as a striking trend that will significantly impact supply chains. Although the expansion of 3D printing in the private consumer market is an interesting development in its own right, the biggest potential for disruption lies in industrial applications and how 3D printing will influence supply chains of the future. In this article, we examine the areas of the supply chain most likely to be disrupted by 3D printing technology and we identify the key questions that must be answered in a roadmap for future research and practice. While we seek answers to these questions, we suggest that managers should develop a flexible change management strategy to mitigate the effects of disruption to their future supply chains and take advantage of the resulting opportunities.

Before open source code is absorbed into a proprietary product, developers must check the package license to see if the project is permissively licensed, thereby allowing for commercial-friendly inheritance and redistribution. However, there is a risk that the open source package license could be inaccurate due to being silently contaminated with restrictively licensed open source code that may prohibit the sale or confidentiality of commercial derivative work. Contamination of commercial products could lead to expensive remediation costs, damage to the company\textquoterights reputation, and costly legal fees. In this article, we report on our preliminary analysis of more than 200 open source cybersecurity projects to identify the most frequently used license types and languages and to look for evidence of permissively licensed open source projects that are likely contaminated by restrictive licensed material (i.e., containing commercial-unfriendly code). Our analysis identified restrictive license contamination cases occurring in permissively licensed open source projects. Furthermore, we found a high proportion of code that lacked copyright attribution. We expect that the results of this study will: i) provide managers and developers with an understanding of how contamination can occur, ii) provide open source communities with an understanding on how they can better protect their intellectual property by including licenses and copyright information in their code, and ii) provide entrepreneurs with an understanding of the open source cybersecurity domain in terms of licensing and contamination and how they affect decisions about cybersecurity software architectures.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,02/2016,2016,Technology Innovation Management Review,License Compliance in Open Source Cybersecurity Projects,article,966,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/966,"contamination, copyright, cybersecurity, GPL, license, open source, third-party code",28-35,6,

By the abstraction of these solutions to transferrable solution patterns, the efficiency of the development process could be increased. In this article, we introduce a systematic approach to develop a pattern system for frugal innovations. Based on 29 selected frugal innovations, we derived the problems that led to the development of the analyzed frugal innovations. By categorizing these problems, we deduced six problem categories: education, environment, culture, infrastructure, regulation, and finance. We stripped down the solutions to these problems to their core principles, and in our subsequent analysis, we identified 56 solution patterns. Moreover, we analyzed the relationships between the abstracted solution patterns, problem areas, and frugal innovations.

It is highly influential in moderating the cognition and behaviour of groups and individuals. Different resources, including cognition and behaviour, are required at the different stages of the innovation process, and the context, including national culture (within which innovation is practiced), is an important consideration in designing strategy. Because innovation is a psychological and social process, understanding how national culture moderates that cognition and behaviour within the different stages of the innovation process and how the wider innovation ecosystem impacts innovation practice is central to understanding, strategizing and managing the innovation process.

We tracked cohorts of new micro-sized firms (startups) over five years from birth. Compared with startups that had a low employment growth trajectory, medium- and high-growth micro-startups exhibited higher financial performance, higher innovation activity, and a greater propensity to seek external (debt or equity) finance. From a management perspective, medium- and high-growth startups were also significantly more likely to monitor and assess their performance across a wider range of performance indicators.

Yet, little is known about the value and economic impact of expenditures on outsourced innovation activities, which are often referred to as ""hidden innovation"" by many scholars. The issue is due largely to a lack of consistent measurement, available data, and analyses of expenditures on hidden innovation. In contrast, there is a long history of cross-country data collection on in-house research and development (R&D) activities and costs, and much research focuses on innovations involving in-house R&D effort. This study reviews results from a survey aimed at collecting new economy-wide data on external innovation investments in Australia. The results estimate total unmeasured or ""hidden"" investment in external innovation activities by Australian businesses at $3.5 to $4 billion in 2014, an amount large enough to stimulate important economic activity and warrant future research.

Patents are the outcome of innovation processes that take several month or even years, depending on the industry. The process of publishing patents usually lasts longer.

Therefore, a patent is a weak indicator for the identification of early innovation activities.

Results revealed that users accept advertising and will perform requested actions if they can perceive the delivered value.

Yet, despite the availability of information, managing healthcare-associated infections remains a challenge because the relevant explicit knowledge is not being adequately developed and mobilized as tacit knowledge for use ""on the front lines"". Some researchers have called for a human factors perspective to help address challenges in designing for infection prevention and  control, but relatively few studies have been conducted to date. Researchers also suggest that empirical inquiry is needed to better inform the design process, and particularly the design of complex systems where attention to detailed processes and interactions can support the success of an intervention. A human factors approach can help designers develop a deeper understanding of work processes, technology considerations, as well as physiological, psychological, cultural, and organizational factors. The need is particularly pressing in low-resource healthcare environments where funds, time, and human resources may be scarce and strategic design decisions based on evidence are needed to support meaningful and effective changes. With this in mind, a human factors study was conducted in an existing neonatal intensive care unit to identify the influence of product and environment design on infection prevention and control and to inform recommendations for improvement.

The search for new high-growth startups has been particularly topical in Finland, the country that is known for its high-tech products – and the fall of Nokia\textquoterights mobile phone business. Although a record number of startups has been established in recent years, the previously identified challenge is that only a small percentage of entrepreneurial businesses are responsible for the lion\textquoterights share of economic benefits typically associated with entrepreneurial activity. Hence, we need better understanding of what level of growth technology entrepreneurs aim to create and why there may be differences in growth ambitions among them. In this study, we undertook interpretivist case study research in pursuit of rich, empirically grounded understanding of entrepreneurial growth ambitions in the context of Finnish technology startups. We interviewed entrepreneurs at a Finnish startup event and supplemented this information with data available publicly on the Internet related to the growth ambitions of startups. Our study sought to increase understanding of the different aspects of entrepreneurial growth ambitions, and to explore the relationship between context and growth. Based on the findings, we suggest that growth ambitions should be seen as a complex, socially constructed concept. The growth ambitions of entrepreneurs in our study were influenced, at least in part, by their startups\textquoteright institutional and market contexts, the scalability of their business models, their personal characteristics and experience, and their perceptions of the barriers and constraints of the field. We conclude that startups have very different growth pathways: although the growth of one startup may depend on the talent of a few software developers, the growth of another startup may be based on its success in building international sales networks. As a result, to get most out of the support provided for a startup ecosystem, support activities should be tailored to different types of high-growth startups.

The article reports on the initial steps of an action design research approach to support the stakeholders of the Cider Route in designing an innovative solution in response to numerous challenges they face, including a lack of new initiatives and steeply declining membership among cideries. The first step of the action design research was to define the problem: to renew the collaborative process among the Cider Route stakeholders by redefining the vision, mission, and strategy leading to an artifact proposal that could take the form of a mobile application. Thus, the notion of a boundary object is employed – in relation to the process of designing an information technology artifact in the form of a mobile application for the Cider Route – as a way to understand the need to collaborate to innovate in this context. The article also reports on the ongoing second step of the action design research process, which consists of supporting the collaborative process using group concept mapping. The group concept mapping method was suggested to guide and sustain the collaborative process over time because it is a participatory, bottom-up, mixed-methods approach to evaluation and planning. The group concept mapping, applied within the action design research approach, could be helpful in two ways: first, to define the rejuvenated vision, mission, and strategy for the Cider Route; second, to define the specific functionalities of the mobile application for the Cider Route.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,11/2016,2016,Technology Innovation Management Review,Rejuvenating the Cider Route in Quebec: An Action Design Research Approach to Stakeholder Collaboration and Innovation,article,1030,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/1030,"action design research, agrotourism, boundary object, Cider Route, stakeholder collaboration",6-17,6,

The seemingly ever-present problem of long queues for rides and attractions is being tackled by the development of priority systems. These innovations allow customers to join an alternative queue that bypasses the congestion faced by regular customers. In other words, by paying extra, customers can purchase the right to be served sooner. Such systems are becoming prevalent, but there is a lack of empirical research into priority systems at theme parks in the academic and management literature, which suggests that in-depth empirical analysis is necessary in order to understand the consumer decision-making process when making this purchase. This article examines priority systems at theme parks both from the viewpoint of park management and of customers. To address this gap, we surveyed nearly 1,000 customers at a major theme park in Spain and conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 theme park managers to assess both customer and manager attitudes towards waiting generally and priority systems specifically. Our results reveal that these priority systems facilitate market segmentation. When theme parks offer this ""wait or pay"" option, different groups of customers are identified based on their attitudes: those who wait in regular lines and those who are willing to pay to avoid lines. Thus, this innovative system creates an important source of new revenue while also improving the customer experience by reducing waiting times and minimizing congestion. Following a discussion of our results, we offer practical recommendations to managers who need to address the challenges of waiting times in theme parks and wish to improve both profits and customer experiences by implementing a priority system.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,11/2016,2016,Technology Innovation Management Review,Priority Systems at Theme Parks from the Perspective of Managers and Customers,article,1034,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/1034,"innovation, managers, priority queues, theme parks, tourism, tourist behaviour, waiting time",40-47,6,

In our view, the underlying reason is the lack of collective action involving various organizations in the design process. Collective action for the good of the whole ecosystem does not take place in existing participatory practices because of the dominating role of a single customer or designer organization (in urban development projects typically the owner-developer or lead architect), who uses their bargaining and decision-making power over others. This leads to sub-optimal behaviour where the system is optimized for the goals of one strong organization instead of collectively developed system-level goals of the business ecosystem as a whole. The Cuckoo\textquoterights Nest approach addresses this problem by inviting various expert organizations to design the system and assigning each organization design rights for the ecosystem and its system-level goal. The Cuckoo\textquoterights Nest approach enhances collective action among the organizations by making individuals from various organizations consider the interests, goals, objectives, and value-adding elements of other organizations – not just those of their own organizations. With the Cuckoo\textquoterights Nest approach, the business ecosystem comes first, and single organizations\textquoteright goals or specific design features come second.

Many of the distinctive characteristics of public sector decision-making processes pose a challenge for innovation collaboration with external actors. Often, external actors are not aware of these distinctive characteristics, or they find it very difficult to adapt to them. Particularly SMEs and startups find it difficult to adjust their operation to public sector decision-making processes. The existing literature includes very little knowledge of how such an innovation platform, which is an intermediary between a city and external actors, relates to the city\textquoterights decision-making processes. Still, this is an important issue considering the prerequisites of the success of an innovation platform. This qualitative explorative study is based on data from in-depth interviews and co-creative multi-actor workshops with participants from city governments and other organizations.

By means of a case study, we show how field trials can be evaluated in a more structural way to cover all dimensions of context and how this same framework can be used to evaluate context in the front end of design. This framework implies that living lab researchers are no longer dependent on the technological readiness level of a product to evaluate all dimensions of context. By using the proposed framework, living lab researchers can improve the overall effectiveness of methods used to gather and analyze data in a living lab project.

However, the literature has not provided insights on how living lab projects can implement real-life experimentation in B2B innovation projects and does not describe appropriate conditions for experimentation in these settings.

Our research is positioned in the contextual ambidexterity perspective. In this article, we apply the typology of four ambidextrous behaviours developed by Birkinshaw and Gibson (2004) to increase our understanding of the process whereby organizational actors are able to build on existing capabilities or business processes while developing new ones. Our results indicate that at least three of the ambidextrous behaviours proposed by Birkinshaw and Gibson (2004) (initiator, broker, and multitasker) are helpful to understand how new product development team members rely on proven approaches while simultaneously introducing new ones to successfully overcome daily challenges.

Most previous research on ecosystems has focused on firm-level strategies to operate in an ecosystem rather than the composition or orchestration of an ecosystem as a whole. However, finding the balance between the self-interests of involved actors is critical in order to create collaborative settings that induce different parties to jointly develop and put their best efforts into a joint endeavour. Thus, we undertook a qualitative study with 35 case companies from the metal and engineering industries, each of whom was interested in developing their position in ecosystems and improving their relational business practices. The findings suggest that there is an essential ecosystem competence that is needed by all actors in an ecosystem, regardless of their position, and that is the ability to manage dynamic strategic interactions related to innovation. This competence enables them to ensure the future vitality of the ecosystem and their own business.

Developers of security analysis systems face the challenge of developing a system that can present different sources of information at multiple levels of abstraction, while also creating a system that is intuitive to use.

We then apply this paradigm to the context of research at universities and other research organizations. The article is based on the assumption that the organizational context matters, and it shows how a deeper understanding of the research context could enable an acceleration of the innovation process. We complement theoretical examples with a case example from VTT Technical Research Institute of Finland. Our findings show that many of the concepts from early-acceleration phases – and the lean startup paradigm – can also be relevant in innovation discussions within the research context. However, the phase of value-proposition discovery is less adequately addressed, and that of growth discovery, with its emphasis on building on a scalable, sustainable business does not seem to be addressed with the presented innovation approaches from the research context.

Globally, urban living labs have become a fashionable phenomenon to tackle this challenge, fostering the development and implementation of innovation, experimentation, and knowledge in urban, real-life settings while emphasizing the important role of participation and co-creation. However, although urban living labs could in this way help cities to speed up the sustainable transition, urban living lab experts agree that, in order to truly succeed in these ambitious tasks, the way urban living labs are being shaped and steered needs further research. Yet, they also confirm the existing variation and opaqueness in the definition of the concept. This article contributes to conceptual clarity by developing an operationalized definition of urban living labs, which has been used to assess 90 sustainable urban innovation projects in the city of Amsterdam. The assessment shows that the majority of the projects that are labelled as living labs do not include one or more of the defining elements of a living lab. In particular, the defining co-creation and development activities were found to be absent in many of the projects. This article makes it possible to categorize alleged living lab projects and distill the “true” living labs from the many improperly labelled or unlabelled living labs, allowing more specific analyses and, ultimately, better targeted methodological recommendations for urban living labs.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,07/2017,2017,Technology Innovation Management Review,The Defining Characteristics of Urban Living Labs,article,1088,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/1088,"characteristics, cities, definition, living labs, TIM Review, urban living labs",21-33,7,

Such negative consequences are particularly obvious in the context of developing countries and extreme poverty, where innovation\textquoterights contributions to inequalities are considered an issue of social and economic exclusion. In response, the concept of inclusive innovation has been developed to provide frameworks and action guidelines to measure and reduce the inequality-increasing effects of innovation. In developing countries, attention has only recently turned to the role of innovation in increasing inequalities, for example in the context of the degradation of employment in the transition from production to service industries. Although the focus of this early work is primarily on economic growth, innovation in developed countries also contributes to social exclusion, both of groups traditionally subject to social exclusion and new groups marginalized through arising innovations. This article summarizes the origins of the concept of inclusive innovation and proposes a four-dimensional framework for inclusive innovation in developed countries. Specifically, innovation needs to be inclusive in terms of people, activities, outcomes, and governance: i) individuals and groups participating in the innovation process at all levels; ii) the types of innovation activities considered; iii) the consideration of all positive and negative outcomes of innovation (including economic, social, and environmental); and iv) the governance of innovation systems.

However, the emergence and structure of entrepreneurial ecosystems for technology startups have hardly been traced and examined in detail.

Given this background, we set out to explore and examine the structure, evolution, and growth of ecosystems for technology startups in the context of Bangalore and Hyderabad. Both the ecosystems emerged due to the initial foundation laid in the form of government–industry–academia triple helix and their interactions leading to the emergence of a modern industrial cluster followed by an information technology and biotechnology cluster, which then led to R&D cluster serving both the cities. These three clusters together, gradually and steadily, facilitated an entrepreneurial ecosystem for technology startups to emerge. The ecosystem operates within the triple helix model and has a nucleus with two outer layers: i) an inner layer of primary (indispensable) factors and ii) an outer layer of supplementary (secondary) factors.

However, despite its popularity, I argue that the frugal innovation literature, in its present form, is problematic for at least two reasons. First, the frugal innovation literature assumes that scarcity is a normal condition of the “Global South”. In this article, I show that this assumption neglects the fact that scarcity can be socially constructed to deny certain social sectors the access to resources essential for their flourishing. Second, despite all the good intentions underpinning the idea of “alleviating poverty”, frugal innovation studies rarely challenge, or even discuss, the causes of destitution and social exclusion. Innovation, as well as technology, is overwhelmingly framed in an agnostic and neutral way that sidelines the socio-economic complexity of the exclusion mechanisms that cause poverty and underdevelopment. By ignoring this, the frugal innovation literature risks limiting the understanding of the problems it seeks to solve and, most importantly, it risks limiting its impact. Most frugal innovation literature, in other words, seems to elude the fact that, rather than being a mere lack of resources or technology, poverty is a matter of social justice. In order to be empowering, technology has to be value-based, normative framed, socially controlled, and democratically debated. In this article, I propose that we should use these principles to develop a new wave of frugal innovation literature and practice.

However, most of the frugal innovations, at least at the grassroots level, are makeshift contraptions, made from indigenous ingenuity, that achieve their goals under constraints on various resources but may suffer from limited lifespans due to premature failure. Consequently, it is imperative that sound scientific principles not be overlooked or haphazardly applied in realizing these innovations, irrespective of their grassroots or sophisticated nature. This article therefore argues for the need to use science, sometimes at the cutting edge, to realize grassroots and advanced frugal innovations that are not prone to failure under various working conditions. In so doing, this work advocates the use of classical and new design methodologies that are rooted in science to save resources and, hence lower costs, while aiming for robust functionality of frugal products. In particular, a frugal design approach using a modern version of the safety factor called the “factor of frugality” has been propounded to effectively create any type of frugal innovation from scratch.

The digitalization of new foreign market development helps them to more efficiently identify new market opportunities in global markets. With this approach, they are saving resources while developing the most attractive markets. This article examines how lean global startups develop new foreign markets more rapidly due to digitalization. Thus, the aim is to understand the impact of digitalization on speed of internationalization of lean global startups. The study addresses a gap in the scholarly literature and a practical need to evaluate new foreign markets and business opportunities more quickly and more regularly and to understand what helps lean global startups react more quickly to opportunities and threats with respect to changing market attractiveness. Furthermore, it outlines why and how digitalization is important throughout the internationalization process. The research followed a multiple case-study design using different sources of evidence, including 73 interviews with senior managers of lean global startups. The findings reveal that digitalization allows lean global startups to increase decision-making efficiency and to optimize strategies and processes for evaluating international markets. The findings suggest that lean global startups can benefit from the use of digital technologies by applying a more efficient foreign market development process with regular reviews and a reduced workflow, by faster mediation between local market realities and strategic goals, by analyzing all foreign markets instead of just a sample of them, and by optimizing decision-making processes including the ability to make long-term, strategic decisions due to better market information.

Two organizational models – living labs and innovation integrators – are commonly used as hubs to broker these ecosystems. Curiously, both coexist in some cities, allowing a comparison of their impact and an analysis of their development over time and in context. The case studies presented in this article suggest that our analytical frameworks for technology policy may fall short, in that they contemplate only the organizations themselves – the living labs or innovation integrators. The dynamics observed in each city are well articulated, however, in the sociotechnical systems literature. The hub can be understood as a “niche”, which fosters radical innovations and new processes. As these prototypes are increasingly deployed and accepted, there is a regime shift, ultimately creating an experimentalist culture that fills the role previously held by the hub. This conclusion is neither a challenge to ecosystem theory nor a critique of innovation policy and its implementation. Rather, I suggest that we must extend these theoretical frameworks, drawing on sociotechnical systems literature to better account for institutions and for systems change as we design policy for urban technology.

In this article, we reflect on two decades of transdisciplinary inquiry at the Institute for Sustainable Futures. Drawing on that experience, we argue that one crucial innovative practice is to create space for collective, reflective learning. Such learning frequently takes place in spaces we call “crossroads”. These are formal and informal spaces where practitioners who have been on their own transdisciplinary learning journeys (experiencing diverse tensions and applying diverse approaches) come together in dialogue to share, reflect, critically and constructively question, imagine, challenge, and synthesize their experiences into collective organizational learning. Crossroads can emerge spontaneously but can also be consciously nurtured.

Although transdisciplinary learning has been studied and experimented with in educational research, the understanding of it in a professional context is limited. We therefore aim our research at addressing this question of how people shift their practice towards other disciplines to address complex issues. We chose to focus on a particularly challenging context – the shift from positivist to non-positivist learning across the career of transdisciplinary innovators when addressing complex problems. What makes this context challenging is that the siloed and heavily specialized nature of working within a disciplinary construct discourages collaboration on real-world complex problems. This context is also challenging because the analytic focus from positivist disciplines results in a reductionist approach, which limits an innovator\textquoterights ability to explore problems holistically and abductively. An understanding of the learning experiences of practitioners in these contexts will inform the identification of relevant variables and attributes that encourage innovative learning for ultimately innovative practice.

In addition, these definitions identify the “immigrant”, “ethnic”, or “migrant” entrepreneur as the focal actor rather than the company. This makes it difficult to align transnational entrepreneurship with the theory of the firm and provide practical insights to practitioners. This article examines 11 definitions of transnational entrepreneurship, discovers the groups of words that best represent the information in a corpus comprised of 44 journal articles, identifies the key features that distinguish transnational entrepreneurship from other forms of entrepreneurship, and advances a new definition of transnational entrepreneurship. The results indicate that transnational entrepreneurship has two key distinctive features: cross-border investment logic and institutional distance – the difference in institutional context between countries. Accordingly, transnational entrepreneurship may be usefully defined as “a cross-border investment to acquire, combine, and recombine specialized individuals and heterogeneous assets to create and capture value for the company under conditions of institutional distance and uncertainty”. This proposed definition builds on the features that make transnational entrepreneurship distinctive, is consistent with the theory of the firm, and carries implications for how to grow companies at an early stage.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,09/2018,2018,Technology Innovation Management Review,Transnational Entrepreneurship: Distinctive Features and a New Definition,article,1184,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/1184,"cross-border, definition, entrepreneurship, features, topic modelling, transnational",28-38,8,

There is no support for the notion that more renowned and higher-ranked journals would be more hesitant to accept articles with action research methods. The study also notes that there are interesting outlets beside those highly ranked and indexed in more conventional ways. The conclusion reached is that we lack a clear answer to the question of what are the best outlets for those of us who are interested in both innovation and action research. Instead, the study invites us to reflect upon what kind of impact we want to have and then act accordingly.

There are claims in the community of participatory and action research of the potential for heightened scientific excellence, but at the same time, there are critiques in the mainstream community that more engaged, even activist, stances threaten scientific norms or that position these type of research approaches outside the field of science, for example, as issues of application. In the search of clarification of the scientific identity and the specific qualities of participatory and action research, scholars have been moving away from and sometimes have rejected traditional conceptions of quality. This leads to confusion about how to relate to the discourse on research quality and scientific excellence in mainstream science. Integration in this discourse is important in order to attain academic legitimation in prevailing institutions of science, for example, in applications for funding, in seeking to publish research, and in the acceptance of dissertations based on participatory and action research. The purpose of this article is to contribute to this integration by reconstructing the way traditional quality concepts – validity, reliability, and objectivity – can be fruitfully used in expanded frameworks for quality where scientific excellence of participatory and action approaches are visible and where mainstream science approaches also can be harboured. In this conceptual article, reconstruction of understanding of scientific inquiry is first made based on a praxis-oriented epistemology inspired by pragmatism. Through rethinking truth as trustworthiness, new proposals for the conceptualization and frames for research quality and scientific excellence are introduced. Second, a framework for understanding purpose in science and its basis in validity, reliability, and the core characteristics of participatory and action research is developed. Third, the turn to action, practice, and participation enables plural ways of knowing and ways that knowledge claims can be validated and made trustworthy. The article concludes that participatory and action research offers a broader landscape of purpose and validation than more traditional approaches to science. In a subsequent article, reliability and objectivity, and their use in participatory and action research, will be clarified.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,05/2019,2019,Technology Innovation Management Review,Scientific Excellence in Participatory and Action Research: Part I.

The article shows that it is fruitful to consider the “subjective” and active role of researchers as vital in enabling scientific objectivity and reliability. As an expansion from a replication logic, reliability can be conceptualized as adaptive, goal-seeking, dynamically regulated processes enabled by effective organization of interactive and participatory learning processes where all participants can contribute to learning and correction in inquiry. Instead of erasing subjectivity, objectivity can be enabled by critical subjectivity, intersubjectivity, practical wisdom, impartial norms of inquiry, and open democratic dialogue. Reliability and objectivity in this understanding can be enabled by participatory and action research through skilful performance of research practices such as reflective conversations between parties, dialogue conferences, experimentation, and experiential learning as part of action-research cycles, etc., which are common in participatory and action research initiatives and projects. By rethinking validity, reliability, and objectivity, recognizing the substantially more active and participatory stances enables scientific excellence, it can expand the repertoire of strategies for promoting research quality, and it helps to mainstream this type of approach in the scientific community.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,05/2019,2019,Technology Innovation Management Review,Scientific Excellence in Participatory and Action Research: Part II.

These enablers, in turn, facilitate development of various aspects of the smart city including, e.g., transportation, governance, education, safety and communications. However, the transition towards smarter cities involves not only technological development but also the changing and evolving roles of citizens, service providers and city authorities. In this transition, the key issue is creating and growing roles of collaboration, participation and coordination. Whereas mainstream research focuses on smart city transformation in big cities, aspects of this transformation in the context of small cities has been a widely neglected topic. This paper presents three cases of smart city development in small cities in Finland, each concentrating on a different aspect of smart city development. The cases reveal how a relatively small-sized city may take remarkable steps in smart city development by selecting a specific theme on which to build smart city activities. These examples also emphasize the critical role of public sector actors, showing that the public sector has a key role in creating the foundations for fruitful ecosystem-based development work.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,09/2019,2019,Technology Innovation Management Review,Towards a Smart City Concept in Small Cities,article,1264,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/1264,,5-14,9,5

We show the flip side of managerial attempts to provide feedback and foster employees&rsquo; creative output. In particular, we identify distinct practices organizational actors employ along the sequence of idea generation, elaboration, championing, and implementation, and find that the practices can turn organized innovation management efforts into a political process. Furthermore, we present a virtuous and a vicious circle of managerial attempts to manage creativity in innovation processes. In doing so, we highlight the value of taking a practice lens to better understand the challenges in organized innovation management efforts and propose future research in other contexts.

Policy makers world-wide nowadays aim to foster environments conducive for AI-based innovation. This paper addresses the current lack of empirical data for evidence-based innovation policies and the management of AI-based innovation. It focuses on &ldquo;AI and innovation management&rdquo; in addressing the question whether innovation that is based on new AI technology requires a management approach different from other forms of IT innovation. We present results from a study of Austrian companies on the degree of use and implementation of AI, and on challenges related to AI-based innovation management. This study used a keyword-list approach to define &ldquo;Artificial Intelligence&rdquo; and to find AI-based innovation projects in research databases. These projects facilitated the identification of experts from organisations developing AI-based innovation. In total, eleven experts were interviewed about their AI-based innovation activities. The results show that AI is a very fast emerging technology that is being applied in many sectors. A broad range of innovative solutions are being developed and some have already reached the market. Specific AI business models are, however, less clear and still developing. Companies are facing multiple challenges from regulation to human resources and data collection. Managing AI-based innovation will be particularly difficult for smaller enterprises, where problems are often more pronounced than in larger industries. Explicit challenges for managing AI-based innovations include the necessary attention to managing expectations and ensuring historic metadata expertise essential for many AI-based solutions. Policies to support AI-based innovation therefore should focus on human aspects. This includes increasing the availability of AI experts, but also concerns the development of new job profiles, such as experts in AI training.

The field has existed since the 1950s and is only now emerging as viable for commercial markets. Many enterprises are placing bets on AI that will determine their future. Today AI innovation becomes useful when it enriches decision-making that is enhanced by applying Big Data (BD) and Advanced Analytics (AA), with some element of human interaction using digital platforms. This research investigates an opportunity for cross-fertilization between AI, BD, and AA with related disciplines. The paper aims to investigate the potential relationship of AI, BD, and AA with digital business platforms. In doing so, it develops a multidimensional BD-driven AI innovation taxonomy framework with an AA/BD/AA innovation value chain, related levels of BD, and analytics maturity improvement.

At the front-end of innovation, firms are challenged to evaluate growing amounts of information within shorter time frames in order to stay competitive. Either they spend significant time on structured data analysis, at the risk of delayed market launch, or they follow their intuition, at the risk of not meeting market trends. Both scenarios constitute a significant risk for a firm&rsquo;s continued existence. Motivated by this, a conceptual model is presented in this paper that aims at remediating these risks. Grounded on design science methodology, it concentrates on previous assessments of innovation search fields. These innovation search fields assist in environmental scanning and lay the foundation for deciding which opportunities to pursue. The model applies a novel AI-based approach, which draws on natural language processing and information retrieval. To provide decision support, the approach includes market-, technology-, and firm-related criteria. This allows us to replace intuitive decision-making by fact-based considerations. In addition, an often-iterative approach for environmental scanning is replaced by a more straightforward process. Early testing of the conceptual model has shown results of increased quality and speed of decision-making. Further testing and feedback is still required to enhance and calibrate the AI-functionality. Applied in business environments, the approach can contribute to remediate fuzziness in early front-end activities, thus helping direct innovation managers to &ldquo;do the right things&rdquo;.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,12/2019,2019,Technology Innovation Management Review,Leveraging AI-based Decision Support for Opportunity Analysis,article,1289,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/1289,front-end of innovation; environmental scanning; information processing; opportunity; innovation search field; information retrieval; artificial intelligence; decision-making; latent semantic indexing; design-science,29-35,9,29

At a high-level, the 3S Process consists of three stages (Story, Strategy, and Solution), which are described in detail in the article. Stage 1: Story in the process is inspired by the Harvard Case Method to provide context for a problem. Stage 2: Strategy uses Design Thinking to produce candidate solutions. The substage of Empathy in Design Thinking plays a crucial role to reduce bias in designing AI. Virtualization technology is a tool for students to experience hands-on learning in prototype development. Stage 3: Solution is where students advocate for their conceptual AI solution in the context of the case study. AI is a type of complex system; therefore, students should consider feedback loops and the potential for unintended biases to enter a deployed solution.

In comparison with former ways of doing business in isolation, ecosystems nowadays have created ample opportunities for generating significantly more values. However, there are also potential threats in the pathway towards success in ecosystems. Ecosystem value creation and capture (EVCC) has recently gained significant attention in the academic literature of business and management. Yet, due to the complex structures of ecosystems and ambiguity in understanding value creation and capture in ecosystems, the contributions heretofore are fragmented, where scholars analysed different aspects of EVCC. The present study offers a systematic review of the literature to shed light on the EVCC studies. The content analysis of a fine-grained sample of articles relevant to EVCC revealed that despite the initiation of discussions in 2007, the topic did not gain noticeable attention until 2016.

The study contributes to current literature by suggesting that there are two underlying ethical and moral dimensions behind these perspectives, namely the “ethical agency of smart robots” and “object of moral judgment”, as well as what this could look like as smart robots become more widespread in society.

Most of the corpus in this field addresses engineering product development that relies on systems and subsystems with years of prior experience in testing, development, and operation. These often have known or existing solutions, and use state-of-the-art (SOA), or near SOA technology.

This rapid R&D methodology enables a rapid acquisition of critical knowledge to understand potential failure modes of concepts in a set-based way. Thus, it enables intelligent decisions for the selection of the final concept as well as the continuous maturation of parallel concepts. The continuous, parallel maturation of multiple concepts enables effective off-ramps in the design process as requirements and new knowledge arise in the course of the development program, without incurring excessive rework, cost growth, and schedule creep.

These phases are iterative by nature and follow partial stage model logic, hence combining elements of both the waterfall and agile methods. For technology and manufacturing companies, the new model presents a new way to consider ideas related to new product, service, process, and business model development.

Products now must enter to the market as fast as possible. The verification and validation (V&V) process is normally the most resource-demanding activity in product development (PD), and thus also has huge potential for improvement. The V&V process is traditionally executed near the end of the development process, and is one of the most critical activities because it identifies design errors. Error correction for a nearly complete product is often difficult and therefore can cause unexpected delays in product delivery. Performing V&V activities in early phases of the PD process and utilising V&V methods other than testing has proven to be a good approach to reduce risks associated with taking a long time to reach the market. However, V&V can only be carried out when verifiable requirements exist. This paper focuses on the importance of moving V&V activities to each phase of PD by defining the requirements for components and modules. In addition, we explore how some of product-level requirements can be verified before a product has been integrated, and explain the difference between definitions of verification and validation requirements. Finally, we present the idea of changing the focus of verification activities from being set-based in the early phase of development, to being point-based when the product is close to completion.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,03/2020,2020,Technology Innovation Management Review,Enabling Rapid Product Development through Improved Verification and Validation Processes,article,1334,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/1334,"agile, requirements, set-based design, validation, Verification",25-36,10,25

The five competitive forces are: the threat of new entrants, the bargaining power of buyers, the bargaining power of suppliers, the threat of substitute products of services, and the rivalry among existing competitors. This framework has recently come under scrutiny and been called into question. To contribute to the debate, this paper investigates the relevance of Porter\textquoterights framework by contrasting vastly different industries. The use cases consist of a resource-based, capital-intensive industry, the mining industry, and a knowledge-based, labor-intensive industry, the information technology industry. Drawing from research on Porter\textquoterights Five Forces framework, and through an internationalization lens, the paper proposes a modified framework augmented with four additional forces. These additional forces are: the competitor\textquoterights level of innovativeness, exposure to globalization, threat of digitalization, and industry exposure to de/regulation activities. These forces were added to capture the increased interconnectivity and complexity of businesses operating in the 21st century.

Relying on distributed ledger technology (DLT, blockchain), the method of ""tokenization"" now seems to be the next way for digital economics to be actualised in practise. Digitalizing some of the production and selling processes through crypto-tokenization technology has brought with it new perspectives and opportunities. Any thorough consideration of the logic of ""distributed systems"" applied to economics is bound to see that it potentially brings considerable disruptions and significant changes in how companies get access to funding.

However, it has been shown that few companies fully understand the value that digitalization projects can create for them, while many companies still launch digitalization projects without having gained much understanding. This contributes to the current ""alarmingly"" low success rate for digitalization projects. Developing effective methods to specify the desired values of digitalization projects has hence become important. One step in developing improved specification methods is to ask what the possible barriers are to improving current value specification practices. The purpose of the current study is to address this. We analyzed several digitalization projects regarding how specifications of desired project value were carried out, finding that very limited resources are spent on specifying desired values in digitalization projects, this limits project success. Likewise, there are several barriers to increasing resources for specifying desired values.

Based on a mixed method approach of 21 European living lab cases, the analysis reveals a pattern of three different processes for living lab organizational and actor roles: living labs organized as cross-sectorial collaboration, living labs emerging within the public sector as main initiator and beneficiary, and living labs developed by civil society actors. The findings are presented as three scenarios for implementing living labs, which also acts as a background for the article\textquoterights final discussion about the potentials and pitfalls of living labs in public sector contexts.",Ottawa,,Talent First Network,12/2021,2021,Technology Innovation Management Review,Living Labs for Public Sector Innovation: insights from a European case study,article,1464,http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/1464,"Citizen engagement, co-creation, living labs, Open innovation, Public sector innovation",47-58,11,47

Up until now, most of the current studies focus on digital transformation in advanced and dense societies, especially urban areas and technologies. Hence, the phenomenon of DT is under-researched in the context of rural and sparsely populated contexts. This study aims at exploring how a rural living lab (RLL) can be shaped and how this approach can be designed to support digital transformation processes in rural contexts. In so doing, following a design science research methodology (DSRM) approach, we have made an artefact (that is, RLL framework) that is an ""instantiation"" that supports user centric digitalization of rural areas. The designed framework is developed based on the key components of ""traditional"" and ""urban"" living labs, as well as empirical data which was collected within the context of the DigiBy project. The DigiBy project aims at conducting DT pilots in rural areas to elevate peoples\textquoteright understanding of digitalization and the application of digitalization opportunities for service development in rural areas in the north of Sweden. As a result of these studies, five key components that guide the design of digital transformation pilots in rural areas emerged, namely: 1) rural context, 2) digitalization, 3) governance, control, and business mode, 4) methods facilitating DT processes, and 5) quintuple helix actors.

One challenge involves the potential impact of ULLs in contributing to meaningful transformative changes. By combining a literature review with a comparative case study of three ULLs in the city of Groningen, the Netherlands, this study confirms and adds to current theoretical positions taken about how to overcome the challenge in terms of holding a shared ideology and reviewing the concepts of agency and power. It also shows that opportunity comes along with trust-building among stakeholders in ULLs, as a way to enhance their potential in practise.

This study aims to identify whether artificial intelligence is a potential critical success factor for construction project success. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using content analysis. The interviewees were selected on the basis of convenience and included highly experienced project managers from the global community with expertise in project management working on large construction projects. Our research shows that senior project managers perceive artificial intelligence as different from information technology and advanced project management software. Major drawbacks of artificial intelligence were found to be (i) lack of soft skills, (ii) lack of intelligence to interpret things in various ways like human beings, and (iii) lack of human relationship capabilities, including the ways people manage projects. The interviewees believe that artificial intelligence is still years away from becoming self-aware.

While the success rate of crowdfunding projects is somewhat low, scholarly understanding of what distinguishes projects that reach their fundraising goals from those that fail remains incomplete. Further, studies on crowdfunding success often examine a number of variables that make predicting success a challenge for entrepreneurs wiling to use crowdfunding. This study uses topic modelling on a data set of over 21,000 technology projects from Kickstarter to investigate if short-text project summaries can reveal predictors of fundraising success on crowdfunding platforms. The results indicate that compared to those that fail in fundraising, project summaries of successfully funded technology projects put forward more trendy topics, use wording that reflects novelty, and focus on solving a social problem.

However, comprehensive data-driven value creation opportunities, which are seamlessly connected to various needs in the everyday life of citizens or residents, are still largely untapped and unstudied. This article investigates value creation opportunities for holistic housing concepts with related ecosystems designed to combine the physical environment of residents along with a digital platform. The novelty of this study builds on a holistic understanding of value co-creation in housing, enabled by digital platforms at the ecosystem level. The empirical study focuses on a qualitative multi-case study of four holistic and resident-centric service concepts, which all include digital platforms. The main findings are concluded as follows: First, digital platforms enable various value creation opportunities in resident-centric housing concepts and related ecosystems. Second, exploring strategic choices regarding competitiveness, innovation, and growth revealed that digital platforms played various roles such as informative, supportive, integrative, or even embedded in novel housing as a service platform concepts, which call for totally new orchestration and business models across traditional industrial and ecosystem boundaries. Third, in light of the basic mechanisms for ensuring competitiveness and growth in data and a platform economy, we identify two main alternative strategic approaches.
