It is no surprise that the notion of digital transformation has garnered much research interest, especially from the practitioners\\\\textquoteright point of view, but academic achievements are somehow lagging behind, possibly because frameworks for digital transformation are still evolving. In this article, we tried to address that gap by conducting holistic research of digital transformation in companies. We used a series of in-depth interviews to inform comprehensive case studies of three companies from different industries that are in different stages of digital transformation. We carefully investigated the companies\\\\textquoteright experiences in the process of digital transformation, which are discussed here to provide valid theoretical framing. We conclude that, in addition to technology adoption, important factors for successful digital transformation are the ability of an organization to change and operational excellence in the integration of external digital services with internal IT support. In that light, we summarize our findings in a form of discovered (sub)dimensions that are the basis for the proposed digital transformation framing, while the narratives and case experiences provide with examples of best practice.', 'author': \"Lucija Ivančić and Vesna Bosilj Vukši\\\\ ́and Mario Spremi\\\\'\", 'chapter': ' ', 'doi': ' http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/1217', 'id': 1217, 'issn': '1927-0321', 'journal': 'Technology Innovation Management Review', 'keywords': 'case study, change management, digital business, digital model, digital transformation, digital transformation model, digitization, human capital, Innovation management, talent management', 'month': 2, 'pages': '36-50', 'pk': 456039238107734293, 'title': 'Mastering the Digital Transformation Process: Business Practices and Lessons Learned', 'url': 'https://timreview.ca/article/1217', 'volume': '9', 'year': 2019}, page_content='Furthermore, alongside the adoption of digital technologies, our companies stressed the need for a quality enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in the background and undertaken efforts to standardize business processes. Process digitization calls for revision and standardization of the process, in terms of workflow, but also the terminology, especially in service industries, which, as also seen in the financial sector, have a diverse portfolio of products and many communication and sales channels. Likewise, Insurer put efforts into employee education and the harmonization of process nomenclature so that a certain product would be offered under the right name to the customer and therefore would launch the correct process instance in the digital platform. In addition to that, an efficient ERP system in the background joins utilized digital technologies into one IT system and empowers information flow.\\n\\nInnovation'),\n",

Digitalization is one key enabler of servitization. One aspect of this concept can be provided through digital product-service platforms, which may facilitate the enrichment of a market offer, as well as keeping costs under control. Platforms are in general a well-established concept for manufacturing companies, as enablers of rich product offerings based on a few components. Less is known, however, about how the ambition to create digital product-service platforms interplays with the business model innovation needed as a result of the servitization efforts, along with processes and organization.

Information technology is already becoming an integral part of many products, as sensors, actuators, and connectivity are being added to them. Generated data can then be used to improve product functionality itself, or to advance productivity elsewhere in the value chain (Porter & Heppelmann, 2015). To prepare an organization for digital disruption however, can be a major challenge, as its implementation and use can demand complex changes and affect almost the entire organization (Bughin & Zeebroeck, 2017), as well as the business models applied (Kindström, 2010).'),\n",

       "  Document(metadata={'abstract': 'Technology companies scan the competitive arena for patents to discover research activities and technology trends. Patents are the outcome of innovation processes that take several month or even years, depending on the industry. The process of publishing patents usually lasts longer. A huge time gap of up to several years between early research and development activities and published patents is the consequence. Therefore, a patent is a weak indicator for the identification of early innovation activities. However, the inventor needs intellectual assets such as data, knowledge, and expertise to carry out an innovation process. It is likely that these intellectual assets can improve the competitor analysis – rendering them primary targets. In this article, we introduce a systematic approach to detect intellectual property (IP) activities of stakeholders in selected technology fields (e.g., hiring experts, taking part in research projects, gathering specific data). A technology field with a low intensity of IP activities offers great opportunities, which we call a \"white spot\".

Thus, the aim is to understand the impact of digitalization on speed of internationalization of lean global startups. The study addresses a gap in the scholarly literature and a practical need to evaluate new foreign markets and business opportunities more quickly and more regularly and to understand what helps lean global startups react more quickly to opportunities and threats with respect to changing market attractiveness. Furthermore, it outlines why and how digitalization is important throughout the internationalization process. The research followed a multiple case-study design using different sources of evidence, including 73 interviews with senior managers of lean global startups. The findings reveal that digitalization allows lean global startups to increase decision-making efficiency and to optimize strategies and processes for evaluating international markets. The findings suggest that lean global startups can benefit from the use of digital technologies by applying a more efficient foreign market development process with regular reviews and a reduced workflow, by faster mediation between local market realities and strategic goals, by analyzing all foreign markets instead of just a sample of them, and by optimizing decision-making processes including the ability to make long-term, strategic decisions due to better market information.

       "  Document(metadata={'abstract': 'Industries across the spectrum are being faced with a fundamental change: digital transformation. The telecommunications industry is no exception. For communications service providers, this transformation started some time ago with the emergence of so-called over-the-top (OTT) services such as WhatsApp and Skype. However, in spite of such transformation being underway, there is a lack of frameworks and tools to help communications service providers navigate such radical change. This article presents the findings of a research project to develop such a framework: the digital maturity model for telecommunications service providers. The model aims to offer a structured view of digital transformation that is specific to the context and challenges of the telecommunications industry and that can be used as a standard to help communications service providers benchmark themselves against peers or themselves as they advance their transformation. This article describes the need for the model and the methodology used to develop it, and it offers recommendations on how to use the model and further develop it as our understanding of digital transformation evolves.', 'author': 'Omar Valdez-de-Leon', 'chapter': ' ', 'doi': 'http://doi.org/10.22215/timreview/1008', 'id': 1008, 'issn': '1927-0321', 'journal': 'Technology Innovation Management Review', 'keywords': 'business, business transformation, digital, digital transformation, digitization, disruptive technologies, innovation, maturity model, telecommunications', 'month': 8, 'pages': '19-32', 'pk': 456039237413038729, 'title': 'A Digital Maturity Model for Telecommunications Service Providers', 'url': 'https://timreview.ca/article/1008', 'volume': '6', 'year': 2016}, page_content='Introduction\\n\\nCommunications service providers are being faced with a deep transformation that is taking them from being providers of traditional communication services (e.g., voice, SMS) into providers of digital services (e.g., music, mobile TV, cloud services, Internet of Things) This digital transformation – the use of technology such as analytics, mobility, social media, and smart embedded devices to improve the performance or reach of an enterprise (Westerman et al., 2011) – also requires communications service providers to digitize the way they serve their customers throughout the entire customer lifecycle.

The application and overlap of these digital technologies are impacting many segments of companies by drastically transforming and dematerializing temporal and spatial dimensions of businesses, as well as expanding global access\" (Hervé et al., 2020).\\n\\n\"A quite different term, digitalization is instead a general tool for BM innovation, as it can contribute to the shift from product to service based businesses. DT relates to the intra-organizational level, involving the external environment with implications for all three dimensions. Therefore, the taxonomy offers a vantage point for subsequent empirical and conceptual research to extend insights on related digitalization themes, especially related to innovation and strategy decisions on scalability, automation, channel selection and connectivity\" (Holand et al., 2019).\\n\\n*Summary*\\n\\nDigitalization refers to the integration and application of digital technologies across various domains, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and more, which are transforming business processes and expanding global access (Hervé et al., 2020). It serves as a tool for business model innovation, facilitating a shift from product-based to service-based businesses.
